19,Daniel Morcombe's killer had a long history of preying on children,"I thought a few of you might find this interesting. if anyone else has stories of cases being close to your family Id love to hear them. As many of you many know the story of Daniel Morcombe and what happened to him, I'll spare the details. 

Few years back when his killer was finally arrested my mother brought me into a room balling her eyes out. I knew something serious had happened, she sat me down and told me how she had been raped and stab in her side by this man when she was my age. Since he was arrested his name and face were all over the news and it was an awful time for her. 

His killer had been someone close to my family back in my hometown. My grandfather went to the trail as witness to his crimes and on behalf of my mother.

A few years back I was in my home town and was helping my grandmother unpack stuff out of a storage unit. We brought a box of photos back ot the house to go though and as we were going though them I saw him. Photos from birthday parties, bbq and other events. Him smiling with my family and my mother, it was truly one of the most horrifying things I'd ever seen.

“They also noted a few photos contained in a locked trunk at the home. The pictures were of a boy wearing a towel coming out of the shower, a boy in underwear, and three more children, fully clothed. Heinrich told investigators the photos ‘just don't look right,’ and the police didn't confiscate them.”

I guess my question is what the hell did he mean by saying they “just don’t look right” and how did this deter the police from confiscating them? Is there more to this? Or did Heinrich basically just tell police “nah, leave those pictures of underage boys, they’re incriminating” and they just.. listened...?

63,"White van is cruising low income neighborhoods and offering $20 for cheek swabs, pretending to be health officials","There is no way this isn't related in crime to some way, so I am posting here although the connection is not yet clear.

&amp;#x200B;

People in a white van have been cruising low-income neighborhoods and homeless camps in Louisville, Kentucky. They ask people to fill out paperwork and collect multiple cheek swabs, paying $20 in cash.

When these people asked who they represent or why they are collecting info &amp; swabs, they have offered different stories, some of which have already been proven to be false. They have claimed the swabs are a ""health screening"" or a test for cancer (not yet possible). They have also claimed to be affiliated with different health groups to different people. Initially they claimed to be affiliated with Passport Health, but Passport denies any affiliation. When a journalist asked for their affiliation and contact information, they were given a phone number for ""Freedom Health"" that was never answered.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think is going on? Some possibilities...

\--someone is getting paid, as a consultant or in a less legit fashion, to populate DNA databases with groups who are underrepresented (most of the neighborhoods they are cruising are low income and predominantly Black)

\--forward-thinking identity thieves

\--renegade sleuth who, based on a suspect description or crime location, is trying to backend identification by doing their own DNA dragnet and hoping to find the suspect or a familial connection

\--local police are running a questionable covert DNA sweep

\--there are just people with a fetish for taking cheek swabs",1,119,"White van is cruising low income neighborhoods and offering $20 for cheek swabs, pretending to be health officials There is no way this isn't related in crime to some way, so I am posting here although the connection is not yet clear.  &#x200B;  People in a white van have been cruising low-income neighborhoods and homeless camps in Louisville, Kentucky.

70,How to break a car window....I am posting this in responce to what happened to Samantha Joshepson.,"Car windows are made out of saftey glass, that means it is resistant to blunt hits, like say from your head in a car accident. If they do break, they shatter completly so you get a hundreads small cuts, instead of one or two deep fatal cuts.

 You can not break a car window by punching it, kicking it, ect. You need to do it with a small pointy object. You can buy a center punch at any auto parts store.

If you do not have a center punch, all you need is your keys. Hold the big end of your keys near your thumb, and close you hand around it, leaving only a small tip sticking out past your pinky. Then hit the window, like you are stabbing the piece of shit who is trying to kidnap you, with the tip of the key. Be sure to shield your face and eyes there will be a lot of glass dust blowing if the car is moving. If the child door locks are activated, you can now open the door/scream for help.

If you are outside the car, and you need to get someone inside the car out, you can always baseball pitch a handful of sand at the window. It sounds odd, but it honestly works.",1,81,"How to break a car window....I am posting this in responce to what happened to Samantha Joshepson.

He says the following:

73,"Anna Delvey, the Soho Grifter: The millennial who scammed her way to being a NY socialite","Exactly how she did it remains a mystery, but the daughter of a Russian trucker managed to scam her way into a luxe socialite lifestyle, mingling among elite circles. Shonda Rhimes (with Netflix) and Lena Dunham (with HBO) are both said to be developing projects based on Delvey’s story. 

Anna Sorokin, 28, was born in Russia and moved to Germany when she was 16. She moved to London to intern for a PR firm in 2011, and then to Paris for a while interning with *Purple*, a fashion and culture magazine. During this period she changed her name to Anna Delvey. This is the last evidence of Delvey having any sort of legitimate employment.

She appeared on the New York scene around 2013 claiming to be a German heiress with a sizable trust fund. In her existence as a faux socialite, she enjoyed dinners with millionaires and the occasional celebrity. She shopped at high-end boutiques and custom-ordered clothing. She visited high end salons for $400 eyelash extensions. She was known for offering generous gifts to friends and hefty tips to hotel staff. She attended Art Basel and posh events at NY Fashion Week. Her adventures and elbow-rubbing were documented on her Instagram account.

In the meantime, she was deep into financial dealings, forging various forms of documentation to secure representation by top legal firms and get meetings with investors and real estate dealers. She was aiming for a loan of over $20 million to fund an arts club. She also claimed she was starting the Anna Delvey Foundation. At one point she chartered a private jet to attend Warren Buffett’s annual meeting in Nebraska.

Things started to fall apart in the summer of 2017. By 2018 she was charged with several counts of grand larceny and theft. She had stayed at several posh hotels, running up hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid bills at 11 Howard, W Downtown, and the Beekman Hotel. She owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to various law firms (Perkins Coie, Lowenstein Sandler, and Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher) that represented her in her attempts to lease space and open up various businesses. She had also convinced friends to cover thousands of dollars’ worth of bills from restaurants, hotels, and resort vacations, but never paid them back. In one instance, she invited a friend on a trip to Morocco and then stuck her with the $62,000 bill. 

Her trial will start soon. According to GQ, she has hired a professional stylist to put together her court looks. Recently, she appeared for a court hearing in a low-cut black dress (reported to be Miu Miu or Michael Kors, depending on the source) and another appearance in Yves St Laurent blouse and Victoria Beckham pants, although she was forced to ditch the stilettos as they were deemed too dangerous by NY Corrections.

The most serious count carries up to a 15 year sentence. If convicted, she will serve out her sentence in the U.S.; regardless, she will eventually be deported having overstayed her visa.

75,Found some shady things in an abandoned car,"There is this place me and some friends go to drink and turn up the volume knob as its pretty remote and nobodys bothering us. Ever since we found the place (about 3 months) there was this car (Citroen) with very dark windows, that made it very hard to ever see anything inside, parked on the road next to the little forest patch. Its been there since before we even knew this place existed so we decided to break in to get away from the cold tonight.
In the front, the casing around the CD player was removed forcibly, as there were a lot scrachtes where the frame used to be. The original key of the car was still in contact, we later disassembled it and found that the circuit used to remotely control the cars locks was removed, possibly to prevent it from getting tracked. The airbags were missing, possibly looted and underneath the steering wheel, there were wires hanging down as if its been hotwired. On the backseat, we found a front bumper, didn't look like the car's and the two speakers on the back doors were missing, whereas the ones on the front were intact. Again, possibly looted. And in the trunk, we found ashes and a lighter, an intact piece of paper suggests these were the documents for the car. A Mercedes purse in witch we found a pair of leather gloves, a weird looking lockpick/key thingy and a plastic zipper bag with a dissasembeled old Nokia phone in it. It was completely picked apart. And last, there was a bent flip sorta knife that couldn't ""flipped"" back in. Also, the car battery was missing but anything else didn't look like it was ever touched, apparently there's even gas in the thing still.
I don't wanna jump to conclusions here, but could this car have been stolen or used in any other illicit activity? Or is it just an old piece of junk forgotten about and used as a stash by some shady dude with a brick phone and pretty sexy looking leather gloves? Should I go to the cops, or just leave it?

77,Question about JonBenet Ramsey case,"I'm sure some of you can relate: I have been fascinated with this case for years and it is an enigma. I was reading through  [this JonBenét Ramsey Case Encyclopedia](http://jonbenetramsey.pbworks.com/w/page/11682477/FrontPage)  today and came to the following section, about which I have a question.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[Did JBR Struggle While Being Strangled?](http://jonbenetramsey.pbworks.com/w/page/11682481/Interpreting%20the%20Evidence#Overview)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Evidence JBR Struggled While Being Strangled**  
&gt;  
&gt;Lou Smit, under questioning by Lin Wood in a sworn deposition in the Wolf v. Ramsey case, stated ""The most significant part of this photograph and what it tells me is the marks above the garotte. Petechiae that was found in the eyes are very tiny, tiny little pinpoint hemorrhages. These are larger abrasions. Dr. Doberson and I both agree that these marks that are above the garotte are fingernail marks made by JonBenet as she was struggling to get that garotte off of her neck. They are half moon in shape. JonBenet also, under her fingernails, the primary source of DNA, is JonBenet's."" Q. On both hands?  A. On both hands.""   
&gt;  
&gt;Immediately after this excerpt, Internet poster Jameson (the source of this leaked deposition) states: ""Note - not all of these photos are available to the public, nor will they be made public by my hand. But Lou is accurately describing them here."" Thus, it appears that the particular photo Smit is alluding to (containing half-moon shaped marks) may not be in the public record.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Evidence JBR Did Not Struggle While Being Strangled**  
&gt;  
&gt;Internet poster [N](http://websleuths.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1193683&amp;postcount=76)uisanceposter has summarized the evidence against JBR's struggling:  
&gt;  
&gt;""I don't think she clawed at her neck while being strangled, because Meyer did not find her skin under her nails. If she scratched at her throat during strangulation enough to leave fingernail marks, then her skin should have been under her nails. It wasn't.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Not only that, there is very little damage to the interior of her neck, as if she didn't struggle at all. The hyoid bone is still intact as were the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and her trachea. The strap muscles of her neck were not hemorrhaged.""  
&gt;

I was reading through  [this JonBenét Ramsey Case Encyclopedia](http://jonbenetramsey.pbworks.com/w/page/11682477/FrontPage)  today and came to the following section, about which I have a question.  &#x200B;  &gt;[Did JBR Struggle While Being Strangled?](http://jonbenetramsey.pbworks.com/w/page/11682481/Interpreting%20the%20Evidence#Overview)   &gt;   &gt;**Evidence JBR Struggled While Being Strangled**   &gt;   &gt;Lou Smit, under questioning by Lin Wood in a sworn deposition in the Wolf v. Ramsey case, stated ""The most significant part of this photograph and what it tells me is the marks above the garotte. Petechiae that was found in the eyes are very tiny, tiny little pinpoint hemorrhages. These are larger abrasions. Dr. Doberson and I both agree that these marks that are above the garotte are fingernail marks made by JonBenet as she was struggling to get that garotte off of her neck. They are half moon in shape. JonBenet also, under her fingernails, the primary source of DNA, is JonBenet's."" Q. On both hands?  A. On both hands.""    &gt;   &gt;Immediately after this excerpt, Internet poster Jameson (the source of this leaked deposition) states: ""Note - not all of these photos are available to the public, nor will they be made public by my hand. But Lou is accurately describing them here."" Thus, it appears that the particular photo Smit is alluding to (containing half-moon shaped marks) may not be in the public record.   &gt;   &gt;**Evidence JBR Did Not Struggle While Being Strangled**   &gt;   &gt;Internet poster [N](http://websleuths.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1193683&postcount=76)uisanceposter has summarized the evidence against JBR's struggling:   &gt;   &gt;""I don't think she clawed at her neck while being strangled, because Meyer did not find her skin under her nails. If she scratched at her throat during strangulation enough to leave fingernail marks, then her skin should have been under her nails. It wasn't.""   &gt;   &gt;""Not only that, there is very little damage to the interior of her neck, as if she didn't struggle at all. The hyoid bone is still intact as were the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and her trachea. The strap muscles of her neck were not hemorrhaged.""   &gt;   &gt;""Her tongue and the insides of her cheeks were unblemished as well, and usually stragulation victims will bite their tongue and cheeks during the strangling.""   &gt;   &gt;""JonBenet's neck gives no indication that she was struggling or even conscious while she was being strangled, and when you consider the killer tied the knot and the back of neck and that her long johns were urine-stained in the crotch and in the front, it sounds to me like she was strangled facedown from behind, and she did not struggle against her killer at all.""

82,Why did that Boeing crash? Yet again we don't get an 'ex plane' ation. Turns out Flying Fortresses have a HUGE SECRET to them. Ready??,"Why did that Boeing crash? Yet again we don't get an 'ex plane' ation. Turns out Flying Fortresses have a HUGE SECRET to them. Ready??

\#Imagine you're on a Jumbo Jet airplane and suddenly all the engines stop working, what happens next? Well .... the next thing that happens is that all these bags drop out of the ceiling and you HAVE TO PUT THEM ON, and they make you stoned within seconds so you pass out. Ever wondered why these masks exist? Why is it necessary to sedate airline passengers? 

\#ConsiderThis: In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines fail, only one jet engine is required stay in the air! There is no explanation yet from Boeing or NASA as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating on ONE (not both) wings. Remember the movie Memphis Belle (1990)? Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn’t the plane immediately drop to one side? What about the real life examples where \*ALL\* engines  failed and the massive plane was able to turn 180 degrees and return safely to the ground? (Read: Miracle on the Hudson cited at the end of the OP for an example). Have to agree after the last few crashes that something mysterious is failing within these planes, right? I mean, it's not an led light that's the problem here.

\#BigSecret: Electromagnetic technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\\\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Allied bombing raids using child pilots is the inspiration behind the book Ender's Game. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. Had the allies used normal anti gravity technology to win the war, they would have sent the Memphis Belle boys in flying saucers. The pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and we'd all be in our own saucers today. 

\#TheOnlyReason to build an airplane that could never fly by aerodynamic technology alone \*IS\* to hid the technology from the very pilots who are winning the Allies war. Can you agree that saturated air bombing won WW2? All those houses in that movie The Pianist? 67 Cities in Japan, etc etc. This is how we won WW2. This is how NAZI Germany, North Korea, Japan &amp; Vietnam were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 \*YEARS\*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes since 2014). This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

104,An argument against trying juveniles as adults,"I finished reading Terror by Night by Terry Caffey today, and I was left with one primary and controversial opinion: juveniles should NOT be tried as adults. Note, I didn’t use the word never or always, although if you were to ask me the same question to be applied to today’s society, I would add never.

In Terror by Night, Caffey recounts a horrific evening in Texas when his wife and two sons were brutally slaughtered and his home burned to the ground. Caffey, shot multiple times, survived the ordeal only to learn that his daughter was responsible for masterminding the attack. Ultimately, his daughter was tried as an adult, receiving two life sentences. While she would be eligible for parole after serving 40 years, she would be almost 60 by the time she had a chance to exist as a free person. Her father vehemently defended his daughter and openly forgave her and the two others responsible for the deaths of his family. Caffey argued that the killers should be spared from the death penalty, which they were, mainly due to Caffey’s insistence.

This is just one example, but as I mentioned before, this is the one that made me again think about some of the reasons why trying a juvenile as an adult is not good for society as a whole. I do believe in rehabilitation as part of our society’s penal system, despite it being very clear that our society more-so values the punishment aspect. One of my primary arguments against trying minors as adults is the message it sends: Society is unforgiving and does not believe you can change. While it’s true there are some people imprisoned who should never re-enter society, there are real-life examples of inmate reform…even those in heinous crimes. We eliminate the chance for an adolescent, who’s brain has not yet completely developed, to make anything of their life or repay their debt to society.

A second reason I have to back my argument is even more simple than the first, but just as worthy of discussing. Why are we choosing to sentence juveniles as adults? The most common answers I found in cases I researched are due to the brutal nature of the crime and the prior record of the juvenile. My first response to this would be, simply, why are we as a society seeing an offender who is, say, 16 or 17, through the eyes of the law as an adult? Our society does not grant juveniles the same rights as adults in other cases, such as access to alcohol, tobacco, etc (as I believe we shouldn’t), yet they can be sent to an adult prison and face adult consequences. Of course you can argue that a sadistic 14 year-old killer should spend the rest of their life in prison, but the child becomes the victim of a failed system here. I’m not by any means saying that juveniles shouldn’t be held accountable for their crimes. Violent crimes, especially, need to be handled with the utmost consideration. However, I believe we need to re-examine this double standard in our criminal justice system.

The bottom line here is that our society needs to be consistent with the way we punish juveniles, and a decision should not be made based on subjective factors, as I believe they are now.

What do you think? Should juveniles be tried and convicted based on their age and psychological development (these inarguably go hand in hand, as the human brain does not fully develop until mid-20s)? Or should the prosecutors reserve the right to pursue charges in an adult court for a juvenile for an extremely heinous crime?

Beginnings

Nestled in the center of Warren County, KY, lies the small town of Bowling Green. Its’ small size and unassuming nature belie the fact that it's actually the third largest city in the state. In the last several decades, the town has seen a massive economic boom and its stature within the state has grown as well. The town is home to the famed Corvette Museum and Factory, Western Kentucky University, now the second largest college in the state, the headquarters of Fruit of the Loom, and the Lost River Cave, one of the most beautiful and unique natural wonders of the United States. With its scenic beauty and thriving economy, Bowling Green has become a beacon of prosperity for the entire state. However, not all that long ago, things were much different in Bowling Green.

Back in 1948, the town was just starting to stretch its feet, with a brand new Union Underwear factory opening up during this time, which provided a greatly needed boost to the town’s economy. Dr. Charles Martin and his wife Martha lived in relative luxury due to a lifestyle afforded to them by Dr. Martin’s status as a prominent physician in town. They lived on the outskirts of downtown Bowling Green in an elegant yet imposing mansion across the street from Fairview Cemetery, where they raised their son Stonewall Martin. The mansion, where the Martin’s would live for 30 years, was bought by the family in 1918 and was considered a local landmark by the population during this time. The Martin’s were well known in the community for the extravagant parties they often held in their home, and on more than one occasion possibly tried to set up their son with someone he could marry. As the years went on and Stonewall grew older, their efforts grew fruitless and Stonewall would find himself a bachelor at age 52.

Harry Edward Kilgore was born on February 28 1923. He lived in Glasgow KY, and much like the Martins, The Kilgores were also well known in their hometown as Harry’s grandfather owned the town newspaper. Despite this, Harry's early childhood must have been filled with hardship, as his father Reed Killgore committed suicide in 1925, leaving his mother Ella to take care of Harry and his sister Ella alone, though she did eventually remarry. In his youth, Harry developed an interest in music, and sought schooling in Glasgow before moving to nearby Bowling Green to attend Western Kentucky University. There, he met Ruth Ann McKinney, a fellow WKU student who was a few years younger than him. Despite this year gap, a connection formed between the two of them, and they quickly became an item. The two students eventually crossed paths George Daggit, who was 35 at the time and a music professor at WKU, as well as the head of the piano department. George and Harry were said to have become very good friends, and would spend days and weeks together at a time. George himself said he only gave extra attention because of Harry’s interest in music, though this would come into question much later on. Around this time, Ruth Ann McKinney came into the company of Stonewall Martin, most likely at a party or some other social function, and the two apparently hit it off, as the two are soon married on June 23rd 1948, leaving shortly after that on their honeymoon. Neither of their lives would ever be the same when they returned.

Blood Sport

Just a few days after Ruth and Stonewall Martin left Bowling Green, on June 29th, under the cover of darkness, Harry Kilgore drove his car to a wheatfield close by Fairview Cemetary. He then grabbed a revolver and walked the remaining distance to the home of Charles and Martha Martin. He broke in through the door and entered the home, where he caught Dr. Martin by surprise in the front hallway. Without hesitation, Harry fired several shots at Dr. Martin, one of which hit him in the head. The wounded Dr. Martin tried to flee back into his bedroom, but the 80 year old retired physician was no match for Harry, and as he fled into his bedroom, Kilgore fired several more rounds into the doctor. Harry then shot Martha Martin in the back of the head as well when she attempted to flee. Evidence collected by police and later Harry’s own testimony showed that Harry spent a great deal inside the Martin home after committing the murders. He allegedly tormented the Martins further, even in death, by abusing their corpses with a flashlight and shooting them both several more times. After stealing some personal items from the family, Harry left the Martin home and later told police he disposed of the gun by throwing into the Barren River as he fled Bowling Green and drove back to Glasgow. Once there, he sought refuge with his mother Ella, where he would be found later by police.

The next morning at around 7am, the bodies of Dr. Martin and his wife were found by two workers who were scheduled to be on the property that morning. Police were quickly called to the scene, and they soon have a lead on the case. Working from a tip, police traveled to Glasgow to talk to Harry. They found him in his car, parked right in front of his mother's house. Police asked Harry to come back to Bowling Green, which Harry did willingly. A search of Harry’s car came up with several of the Martin’s belonging, including Martha’s purse, and a flashlight with broken glass along with 32 calibre shell casings. These were later used to tie Harry to the murders during the trial. In Harry’s original confession, he took full credit for the murders and didn’t name or list anyone else as an accomplice. He stated that he was angry with the Martin’s because their son Stonewall had lured his girlfriend Ruth Ann away from him, and he killed Stonewall’s parents as and act of revenge. From the very onset of the case, Harry’s sanity was continually called into question, and Harry changed his statement several times since his original confession. After being judged as sane enough to stand trial, Kilgore pled guilty to two counts of murder and was sentenced to life in prison for both accounts. Though fourteen months later, after receiving his sentence and being returned to jail, Kilgore made a surprise confession, one that sent ripples through the case, and to this day is a source of controversy and mystery. Despite originally claiming to have committing the murder alone, he now claimed to have had an accomplice; his music professor George Daggit.

According to Harry’s confession, George Daggit and Harry concocted a plan for both of them and Harry’s girlfriend Ruth Ann to lure in Stonewall Martin and use him to steal his parents vast estate. Ruth Ann was to marry Stonewall, then George and Harry were to murder both of Stonewall’s parents so their assets would be inherited by Stonewall. Then they were to murder Stonewall and have Ruth Ann inherit the entire estate. The three of them were then to share the money and live together in luxury for the rest of their lives. Harry’s testimony was heavily scrutinized due to his mental state. Researchers observed his depravity and desire to kill and this caused others to question if Harry was telling the truth. Nonetheless, based off Harry’s testimony, an indictment of accessory and extortion was handed down on George Daggit.

For his part, George fiercely denied the allegations, and provided a timeline of events that occured on the night of June 29th. George stated Harry came to his apartment “very distraught” and asked the professor to come to the university with him. The two made their way to the music building, but left after seeing that the building was occupied. The two walked about town for a time before George returned to his apartment and bid Harry goodbye sometime around midnight. George would even testify to Harry’s mental instability throughout his time as a student at WKU, including his delusions and threats to kill members of his own family. But several key factors and pieces of evidence would cast doubt on Daggit’s innocence. Most damningly, Harry testified that the revolver used in the murders was stolen from a former roommate of George Daggits. The gun was stolen about six months before the murder and four months after George had moved out of the property. Friends and students reported George and Harry had spent a lot of time together in the months leading up to the murders, though George continued to assert he was just helping shepherd Harry’s growing interest in music.

George Daggit would resign from his position at WKU as his trial commenced. George would later be convicted by a jury of his peers and sentenced to 11 years in prison. However, his conviction would later be overturned due to a lack of evidence, and another trial would end in the exact same way, with the charges against George eventually being dismissed. The prosecuting attorney in the trial believed that George was the mastermind behind the murders, and was the contributing factor in Harry’s downfall but not enough evidence could be found to prove this. George fled Kentucky after the trial and moved to Detroit. He apparently found work as a piano player, and would spend the rest of his life their until dying of a heart attack in 1963, although the circumstances surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery to this day.

Wreckage

For her part, Ruth Ann was never investigated and a connection to the murders was never formally established. Although some involved in the case suspected Ruth Ann and even Ella Kilgore were involved in the murders and the conspiracy, nothing ever came of these rumors, and both women lived the rest of their lives in peace. Tragedy would continue to follow the remainder of the Martin family though, as Stonewall would die nine years later in 1957. Whether or not it was a conspiracy or a random tragic coincidence, Ruth Ann McKinney eventually ended up with the Martin Family fortune, which according to sources close to the case, Ruth Ann was in a real hurry to collect. She allegedly visited the Martin’s bank daily for weeks, hounding tellers and bankers for her late husband’s money. Harry was coincidentally up for parole that same year, and was denied by the parole board. Harry’s sanity was questioned several more times in the intervening years, although he was judged as mentally sane and judged to have known the difference between right and wrong each time. He served about 16 years of his life sentence before finally earning an early release on parole. And when he left the jail after all those years, Ruth Ann was waiting for him. As apart of his parole agreement, Harry and Ruth Ann left Bowling Green and moved to Fort Pierce, Florida, where the two lived together until Harry’s death in 1981, when Harry left his house to go on a bike ride and was struck down by a passing motorist. Harry died in the street and was laid to rest in Florida, leaving behind a mystery with more questions than answers.

The murders were a big news story in Bowling Green, with many reporters and journalists from surrounding towns traveling to Bowling Green to cover the story and trial. Questions surrounding the case still remain today, and documents covering the murders as well as documents from both trials can be found in the Kentucky History museum located on WKU’s campus. As for the town, Bowling Green moved on from the murders and has become a symbol of KY’s renewed economic growth. The mansion the Martin’s were tragically killed in still stands today, and has exchanged hands several times since the murders. The house has become infamous in Bowling Green’s history and is referred to as “Murder Mansion” by locals in reference to its’ bloody past. A mythology of sorts has developed around the house in the decades since then. It was reported that when the house was sold in the 60s after remaining vacant since the murders, blood stains could still be seen on the hardwood floors. And as is typical for such crimes, rumors of paranormal activity in the house have persisted since, though previous owners have denied any such activity having ever occured in the house, and these reports remain unsubstantiated. Previous owners have also taken the house’s reputation in stride, carrying on the Martin’s tradition of holding annual parties at the mansion, with some of these parties falling on Halloween. The newest owners of the house has distance themselves from the mansion’s infamous past and discourage sightseers from taking pictures of the house and visiting the property. It seems despite moving on and establishing a new identity for itself, Bowling Green and the “Murder Mansion” will never quite escape the shadow of its’ violent history.

This story ends on an unexpected and somewhat poignant note. While investigating this story, someone close to the case and to Fairview Cemetery reported to me that Ruth Ann McKinney had been back to Bowling Green as recently as 2012 to see if her grave marker next to her first husband Stonewall Martin was still there and open. Despite the tragic events that have marked her life since marrying him, it seems Ruth Ann still holds affection for her husband. It should be noted that though Ruth Ann and Harry Kilgore lived together after his release from prison, they were never married. Ruth Ann was the last survivor of the Martin Murder saga, and she passed away in November 2017. Whatever role she may or may not have played in this mystery, let us hope that Ruth Ann McKinney and the rest of the Martin family have finally found their peace.",1,0,"Murder Mansion: A Saga of Murder, Conspiracy, and Mystery Cross posted from r/nosleep  Beginnings  Nestled in the center of Warren County, KY, lies the small town of Bowling Green.

141,"Is the state of Iowa refusing to test DNA evidence to cover up an old cover up? Or are they just too lazy? Either way, do you think these men are killers?","In 1986 a girl named Kristina Nelson was murdered and left on the Missouri River embankment in Council Bluffa, Iowa. Two brothers, Brad and Danny Harris, went to trial for this where they were found guilty by a jury even though one brother had an alibi and was at work. 

In 2001 a judge ordered that the hair found in Nelson's clenched fist be tested for DNA. It still has not been done. 

The testimony they had saying Brad bragged about how he raped her then his brother killed her was recanted and said to have been a lie so he could get some special treatment. The man was a jailhouse snitch. 

Now, a friend of Kristina's old boyfriend has come forward and said he saw Kristina's boyfriend and another friend leave a party that night to pick Kristina up. When they came back they were covered in blood discussing ways to get rid of a body. The man, a scared teen at the time, helped his friends burn their clothes. They did not come back with Kristina. 

The then boy said he was terrified of the consequences of going againt her boyfriend as he had strong ties to Council Bluffs PD. He ultimately was harrassed so much he had to move to Florida.

The brothers were beaten by other inmates several times being called ""child killers/rapists"".
Brad Harris has since been released and several years after getting out of prison committed suicide. Danny is still sitting in prison maintaining his innocence. The hair has still not been tested. 

Please tell me why the state is more concerned about keeping a man in prison than testing DNA that has been ordered? 

Does this sound like a set up to you? Or does this sound like the state of Iowa is just plain lazy? Is Iowa trying to cover their own mess from the CBPD 30 years ago? 

Did Brad and Danny somehow kill Kristina?

171,Where true crime and reality TV converge,"I feel awful writing this, but I want to know if I'm alone or not. 

I love two types of television: true crime and reality television, and I feel like (for me) there is a point where those two things converge. Hear me out. 

The thing I find the most fascinating about true crime (reading it or watching it or other) is how relationships fall apart, and how people can get to a point of pure rage or otherwise, that I can't fully understand. I watch a lot of these shows and read a lot of these stories because I'm fascinated by how people work - how is it possible that someone could get to such a horrific point? What separates a psychopath from the rest of us? and how do external factors like money, sex, and drugs (cited by most prosecutors and cops as the driving factors behind almost all homicides) drive people to do something like that?

I certainly don't want to belittle any of the very real crimes that I've learned about in my time as a true crime nut and crime/courts reporter, but I also feel that I'm interested in some reality TV for the same reasons: It's all about what makes people tick. How humans interact with each other, how they love and then turn on each other so quickly. 

Both are a sort of look into the human condition, in a way that I find really interesting. 

Before you say it, I know a lot of reality TV is scripted. But some parts and some interactions are real. 

But I'm writing this because I just want to know if I'm alone in that interest. Again, I don't in any way want to belittle the pain of victims and their families, I just want to know, ultimately, what it is that draws us to true crime?

183,"When you killed 7 people, but only got 8 years cause you were underaged","Was reading about killers who have killed in Estonia and realised he did all the killing literallt next door of my new home lmao, but its kinda interestind considering the charge.

Alexandr Rubel was born in 25.12.1980 and is Ukrainian-Estonian. He huffed a lot of gasoline gas and did it everytime before killing.

So in september of 1997, when he was 17, he killed a handicapped man Tõnu who lived above him, because he wanted to know how it feels to kill. And because Tõnu was handicapped he didnt have any defence so it was an easy kill.

In november of 1997, Aleksandr, his father and another neighbour Aleksei were having drinks at Aleksander's place. As Aleksandr and his father belived that Aleksei was courting with his mother/wife, his father stabbed him few times, Aleksandr dragged Pavel to an empty room, strangled him and threw him out of the 3rd floor window. His father was convicted of the murder for 7 years as he took the blame.

In january of 1998, Aleksandr stabbed and killed Jevgeni with a rock in Stroomi beach, he was a random person.

In February of 1998, Aleksander wanted to rob some money and decided that Vladimir is the one to rob. However he showed some resistance so Aleksandr decapitated him with an axe.

Few days later, he killed another neighbour Olga, first stabbed her and then strangled her.

After that he killed another neighbour or visitor Vladimir.

In May of 1998, Aleksandr and his friend decided that they were going to rape a girl Alice who was in Paljassaare beach. However Aleksandr decided to kill her so she was stabbed strangled decapitated and burried her down. He did that all in front of his friends. In court he said about the killing that ,, I feel sorry about her now, but at that moment no. I was afraid that she was going to survive and talk about the incident. Thats why i slicedher throat. The killing fulfilled my moral satisfaction for a month''.

So in June police took him to custody as one of his friends told about killing Alice. And to everyones surprise Aleksander told about all of his murders, which were not investigated or I dont know what the fuck was going on.

So as Aleksandr was underage, he got the maximum sentence which at that time was 8 years (right now its 9 or 10 to juvenile). And in 2006-2007 he was released from prison and emigrated back to Ukraine where he lives now peacefully.

I would like to hear about your opinion. Imo the police work was awful, however it was few years after USSR collapsed and Estonia had been independent for 5 years, so the police was fucked up etc. However literally 4 people in that house died the same way so. Also Kopli and North-Tallinn was not a good place back then compared to now as its full of hipsters and new houses and rich people. And the sentencing was quite a joke, cause the whole system is a joke here.

When I saw her Andrew Cunanan video, I was super excited because I have never heard of this case so I was going into it blind. Let me just say that her way of story telling is amazing and top notch. So many other Youtubers would spend 10-15 minutes max on a person's upbringing, and then focus on the bulk of their video on the crimes they committed and the fallout. However, in typical Stephanie Harlowe fashion, we get a whole hour + video solely about the upbringing of this serial killer without even talking about how they came to be the way that they turned out. I am super excited for this series, and I cannot wait for part two. I advise all true crime addicts to watch her if you haven't heard of her yet!

245,"My Father is carrying out a Death Row sentence as the ""East Bay Killer"" from 1985 but I have reason to believe the crimes may have been committed by the ""Golden State Killer"" instead. Help?","My Dad, Anthony McKnight---is on Death Row in California at the San Quentin Prison. Dubbed the ""East Bay Killer"" by the press, he was convicted initially with 63 years and later in a 2008 trial, given the death sentence when DNA evidence connected him to additional murders. I'm writing you all because i've been suspicious since the arrest of the Golden State Killer last year and my father has maintained his innocence since 1985 (a rarity for serial killers).  Also notable that my father was in the Navy on the Treasure Island Base (same as Joseph James DeAngelo/The Golden State Killer) and the fact that DeAngelo was a former cop with ties to the area and the possibility of getting my fathers DNA. Also of note, in talking to his current attorney (who has been working on his case pro-bono for the past few years because he is convinced my dad is innocent)--- my father was not allowed character witnesses during the original trial---as well as a myriad of other small points of conduct that could be considered a mistrial in itself.

I'm toeing the line between abstaining from naivete over my father's innocence (which i never actually considered until the past year) and the horrible realization that a **crooked serial killer cop could have possibly framed a black man in the 1980's** to throw off the scent. 

And as a victim of sexual violence myself, I'm also trying to be extremely respectful to those who have lost their loved ones in the attacks...  


All of this is to say---**If any of you true crime whizzes out there want to take this on, please do**. The Northern California Innocence Project is overwhelmed right now and my family was just approached this morning by a true crime documentary that basically just focuses on dramatized cheesy serial killer re-enactments and i was considering accepting the offer they gave my mother JUST to bring attention to these coincidences----but a friend told me to ask here. Which is funny, because after 3 years of lurking on reddit I've only made a handful of posts but have always been given a ton of insight and help. So, thanks ahead of time.

281,"After listening to Atlanta Monster, I have two theories. Would love to discuss/","Theory 1:
What if Nathaniel Cater jumped in the river?
 The medical examiner ruled he had died of ""probable"" asphyxia, but never specifically said he had been strangled. Police theorized that Williams had killed Cater, and that his body was the source of the ""loud splash"" they heard as his car crossed the bridge. 

Theory 2:
How are we certain that the carpet fibers found on the bodies are from Williams’ carpet?
The main prosecution evidence against Williams was tiny fibers found on the bodies and matched to rugs and other fabrics in the home and cars of Williams parents. The court filing says the fibers weren’t identical to those in Williams home, and theres no direct connection between him and the bodies.
Williams sought a retrial in 2004 based on the scientific unreliability of the fibers, but a federal judge rejected the request for retrial. How can we be certain that the carpet fibers, the main damning evidence, wasn’t from someone else’s carpet? 

Keep in mind I am not making a statement for or against Wayne Williams. These are questions that I have and I would love to know more on these two subjects, perhaps these questions have already been answered.

292,"Help - Trying to remember a kidnapping case - taken in front of house, across state lines, cabin in the woods","I hope this is the right place to post this - if it not, please direct me to a better place for this!

I am trying to remember a very specific kidnapping case.  I've done a lot of searching but to no avail.  

I believe this happened either the 1990s or the 2000s; I doubt it happened in the 2010s but maybe.  I think the case involved a girl who was taken from the sidewalk out front of her house.  I remember something about the kidnapper taking her across state lines, and wound up keeping her locked in a cabin in the woods in a state in the west/midwest (I want to say some state like Montana, Colorado, etc.  Maybe not that far west but you get the idea).  I remember there was a phone inside the cabin, but she obviously was forbidden from using the phone; I think the kidnapper might have caught her trying to use the phone and cut the cords or pulled them out of the wall or something like that.  I am pretty sure the girl was eventually found alive and returned home safely.  She wasn't gone for years or anything like that, I think it was a matter of days (maybe 11-17 days?  something like that)

There may or may not have been something about the girl having an older sister who witnessed the kidnapping or something; like either the kidnapper got into the house through the unlocked front door and threatened her and took the younger girl.  This is could be from an entirely different case but I figured I'd put it here just in case.  

This is NOT the Elizabeth Smart case, by the way.  This case I'm talking about involved no couple or a wife who was participating in it, it was just the male kidnapper acting alone.  

Any help is greatly appreciated!

This happened in my small town and it is sketchy as hell. Nothing adds up. Car veers off the side of the road and then a young cop murders his cousin and then himself? Also heard that they were shot with shotguns...and you know how shotgun suicides look. This town is backwards and will believe anything the PD releases, but I have more questions than answers. I think something is being covered up and it is driving me insane.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: u/LDMR1 gave this timeline:

&amp;#x200B;

*-Two people found dead in a car crash last Sunday.*

*-Turns out one is a Big Stone Gap, Va 21 year old Police officer Bailey Smith- it was his vehicle and happened in his hometown.*

*-It’s revealed the woman, 26 year old Instagram famous fitness model Emeri Connery. She was from Ohio, in town visiting family for a Wedding.*

*-Rumors swirl that shots were fired after the wreck, it was a murder suicide but no one knows who pulled the trigger.*

*-Virginia State Police confirm they are investigating as murder suicide.*

*-Official town response was to say only great things about him. Pillar of the community, great guy, everyone loved him, etc.*

*-Social media response from various people in the community was there's no way he do that, they were cousins- someone else had to be in the vehicle. Yet, VSP says there was no one suspected and no other persons of interest.*

*-Delusion of the community intensifies.*

*-Days into the investigation, hero’s send off by the town. Anyone who questions the events is said to be “disrespectful” yet it’s obvious that when the autopsies come back it will confirm he murdered her, killed himself.*

*-Any criticism of how the town is handling his vigil, or funeral is met with mob mentality on social media. ""You have to be a awful person to think he murdered her or suspect something more than an accident"" basically.*

*-His funeral consisted of a shrine of his police car, huge America flag in town draped over the procession in his honor- just as the news breaks the VSP rules it a murder-suicide with him pulling the trigger confirmed by medical examiner.*

*-On social media, still local people are delusional saying they don’t believe that, and #BlueLivesMatter, #backtheblue. They won't face the reality of what has happened in their small town.*

*-A Facebook Fundraiser for his funeral costs raises nearly $15k, someone finally decided to do a GoFundMe for her days later- raises only $800.*

*Only rumors as to why he would have done this, and don't want to speculate too much out of respect for the families but I've been able to piece together much more details- so more information to come as they're verified.*

311,Horrific murder of Christine Lee Silawan,"I'm not sure it has got much attention in the West but the dispicable murder of a 16 Yr old school girl here in Philippines has grabbed national attention in the last few days including the intervention of President Duterte. In a country with a murder rate of around 10,000 per year plus an official tally of 5,000 Extra Judical Killings (probably at least double that in reality) since Duterte came to power you can guess this was not an ordinary murder.

Poor Christine was found semi naked on common land just a couple of hundred meters from dense housing last Monday morning having been missing since going to church the day before. The most unusual and revolting aspect was that her face had been skinned off her skull and (though this has not officially been confirmed) her tongue, esophagus and trachea have been removed. There was a witness who claims to have seen the attack taking place by 3 men on the Sunday night. The initial assumption that it was some frenzied rape attack and stabbing (I believe there were multiple stab wounds)  seems to be thrown in doubt by the initial forensics which did not find any recent lacerations of her private parts and presumably no trace of seman. What the motivation for such a brutal and inhuman crime remains to be seen though there are plenty of theories floating around. As you might imagine, the police are under huge public and political pressure to find the purpetrator(s) and this being Philippines are more concerned about catching ""somebody"" rather than getting the right person. If you Google her name there is plenty of English language news coverage of the case but please prepare yourself for some very disturbing pictures.

327,Your opinions on Madaline McCann?,"I'm currently researching the McCann case. I'd like your opinion. 
I personally have always thought the parents were involved. Perhaps she accidentally died and they covered it up, because they were worried the other kids would be taken away? Then moved her body later in the car. 
In interviews the parents act kind of strange. In one I saw, they were asked about the dogs picking up the scent of dead bodies in the apartment. They pretty much cut her off mid-sentance and the father said 'ask the dogs' in a very sarcastic way. Something just doesn't add up for me. In the book, the mother writes about imagining her perfect genitals and her possibly being abused in a sexual way. Kind of an...odd thing to say?
But then I could be wrong, she could have been abducted. But then, what do you expect after leaving your kids alone in an unlocked apartment? You have no idea what kind of people are watching. Also, if you find your daughter missing, why would you leave your other two kids in there and run for help. Wouldn't you take them with you? ",1,108,"Your opinions on Madaline McCann?

Timeline of events to help give perspective:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Two people found dead in a car crash last Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Turns out one is a Big Stone Gap, Va 21 year old Police officer Bailey Smith- it was his vehicle and happened in his hometown.

&amp;#x200B;

\-It’s revealed the woman, 26 year old Instagram famous fitness model Emeri Connery. She was from Ohio, in town visiting family for a Wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Rumors swirl that shots were fired after the wreck, it was a murder suicide but no one knows who pulled the trigger.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Virginia State Police confirm they are investigating as murder suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Official town response was to say only great things about him. Pillar of the community, great guy, everyone loved him, etc.

\-Social media response from various people in the community was there's no way he do that, they were cousins- someone else had to be in the vehicle. Yet, VSP says there was no one suspected and no other persons of interest.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Delusion of the community intensifies.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Days into the investigation, hero’s send off by the town. Anyone who questions the events is said to be “disrespectful” yet it’s obvious that when the autopsies come back it will confirm he murdered her, killed himself.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Any criticism of how the town is handling his vigil, or funeral is met with mob mentality on social media. ""You have to be a awful person to think he murdered her or suspect something more than an accident"" basically.

&amp;#x200B;

\-His funeral consisted of a shrine of his police car, huge America flag in town draped over the procession in his honor- just as the news breaks the VSP rules it a murder-suicide with him pulling the trigger confirmed by medical examiner.

&amp;#x200B;

\-On social media, still local people are delusional saying they don’t believe that, and #BlueLivesMatter, #backtheblue. They won't face the reality of what has happened in their small town.

&amp;#x200B;

\-A Facebook Fundraiser for his funeral costs raises nearly $15k, someone finally decided to do a GoFundMe for her days later- raises only $800.

&amp;#x200B;

Only rumors as to why he would have done this, and don't want to speculate too much out of respect for the families but I've been able to piece together much more details- so more information to come as they're verified.

349,17 year old killed a man because his Adidas tracksuit and shared it with his friends in group chat,"Going to write about interesting murder in Paldiski, which is a small seaside city in Estonia. As Im not English native, there might be mistakes but this really interesting.

So on 30th of October in 2016, 17 year old Magnus was going home from a party when he met a man in his 50s. He asked for a smoke but the man declined so Magnus took out his phone and filmed how he knocked the man out. After that he took photos of the man laying down. After that he dragged the man into the bushes and started to take his Adidas tracksuit off. However the man was starting to wake up and disturb Magnus so he took a knife and stabbed him 11 times. After that he put the coat on the man took the tracksuit and wrote into a facebook groupchat that he had knocked down a man. After that he sent the video and pic and said that he was solving problems. His friends seemed really questioning and didnt believe him. At 3 o'clock he met with a firend and said that the man was hitting on him and it was self defence. He bragged how he knocked him out with one shot and how he knows about killing. He also send a pic of his bruised arm on that group.

The next day police found the body and Magnused shared a news story about it on his own Facebook. After that went for a photoshoot in that same Adi tracksuit and got some new profile pics. He said that he was going to wear it to school next day and when friends asked about last night pics and videos he was really inconclusive. A friend suggested that they all be quiet about this. So Magnus went with the same tracksuit to the school next day, when a police got a hint from a mom who saw her childs messages in that groupchat. Magnus was arrested in school and the knife was found under his bed.

Magnus was sent to prison for 9 years, but as he is young he still has home visits and all that stuff. But none of his friends were guilty in any of this.

394,Issei Sagawa: The Japanese Cannibal Celebrity,"Issei Sagawa was born in Japan premature, which gave him a small stature that he carried throughout his whole life. In early ages, he started having fantasies about cannibalism, and those desires only grew with age. In college, he attempted to kill several women to cannibalize them, but was unable to follow through with any of these acts. However, in 1981, his obsession came to life, and he acted out his fantasy. He killed a classmate by shooting her in the back of the neck, and then, over the course of the next two days, he ate over 15 lbs of flesh. While trying to dispose of the body he was recognized, and it didn't take him long to get caught. His cannibalism itself makes for an interesting story, but the more fascinating part is how he managed to get off, and live life as a free man, and a minor celebrity in Japan.

409,Richard Lawrence Marquette: When a Killer is Released,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/rzo6okts8rl21.jpg

Richard Laurence Marquette was born and raised in Portland, Oregon (December 12, 1934). He was the perfect example of what happens when sick and twisted criminals get released from jail before any real time has been served. His crimes before imprisonment ranged anywhere from attempted rape to burglarizing gas stations armed with a bag full of wrenches as a weapon. He clearly wasn't the best person around in the first place, but his crimes gradually got worse until he became a convicted killer who drained three women of their blood and dismembered their bodies.

His first known murder was Joan Caudle, a 23 year-old Portland woman who had a husband and two children. Police found out about the murder on June 8, 1961, when a lady's pet dog brought home pieces of human body parts it found out in the woods. After it brought back a human hand and foot, the lady immediately called the police to get them involved in a search for a dead body, which eventually lead them to Caudle. The investigation of the victim's last known whereabouts led them straight to a bar, where witnesses remembered seeing the victim with Richard Laurence Marquette. Police then went to Marquette's home, where they found him to be gone. They accessed the home anyways, and found pieces of cut up body parts inside his refrigerator, along with bloody women's lingerie.

Marquette was the first person *ever* to hit number 11 on the FBI 10 Most Wanted List. Only a day after naming him number eleven, the FBI received calls about him being located in California. When the FBI showed up to arrest him, Marquette acted relieved to see them...relieved to be arrested. He didn't put up a struggle, he instead admitted to his crimes and cooperated with police. *According to him*, Caudle had agreed to consensual sex after meeting him in the bar, so he took her to his home, where they were intimate, and then they got into an argument that led to him to choke her to death. He panicked and didn't know what to do with the body, so he dismembered her body in his shower, then disposed of some parts in the river and kept some in his fridge. After everything was said and done, he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. BUT, **he only served 11 years** before he was let out on parole because of him being a ""model prisoner.""

\*\*Side note: How the hell do you let someone out after only serving 11 years for brutal murder? Especially when he was sentenced for life! So messed up!

Continuing on, in 1975, another body was found. The woman, Betty Wilson, had been bled dry and chopped into pieces. Her husband was the first suspect because he had been abusive to her in the past, but because of him being out of state at the time of the murder, it was obvious that it wasn't him. Due to similarities in cases, detectives were then drawn to Richard Laurence Marquette, so they conducted another search inside his home, where they once again found enough evidence to show that he was behind another murder. His story was the same as last time: they met at a bar, he took her home for consensual sex, then he strangled her. The word *consensual* was used by Marquette himself, but police and jurors had a feeling none of the women he assaulted gave him permission. They knew he raped them, but they had no way to prove it. While he was confessing to the murder of Wilson, he also told investigators that he killed another woman, a Jane Doe. A body was never found and no missing persons report was ever filed with her description. 

Three women, all killed in the same way. 

The thing that baffled investigators the most was how well rounded he seemed. He was normal, handsome even, and he had a job working in a thrift shop repairing furniture for resale, and he was a friendly face to those at the bar he frequented. So what was his motive behind three killings? Investigators, despite the fact they couldn't prove it, believed it to be rejection from women that set him off. 

I wish I found more information about his early life, but its pretty limited in the places I searched about him. They should have just let him rot away in jail!

410,Why can’t people consent to data access in case they are subject to a crime?,"  

In so many recent cases, we hear about someone going missing and people around them are unable to access what could be really crucial data sources, such as messages associated with a social media account. Or, law enforcement is trying desperately to get something like cell records, but they are having to go through all the steps and legal processes associated with getting a warrant, which can take valuable days or even weeks. 

As consumers, we sign contracts and check permission boxes all the time. Would it be possible for mobile, social media, email, and app companies to offer user permissions along the lines of “I give permission to law enforcement to access information about my account (including usage, messages, and location data) if:

I am declared a missing person. YES NO

My cause of death is determined to be a homicide. YES NO

I am declared legally dead. YES NO

\[possible other options, like beaten into a coma...\]”

&amp;#x200B;

Each customer could decide whether or not to check “yes” for each of these things. Affirmative consent would be required—the default would be “no”—and the user could revoke that permission at any time. So if you’re only OK with LE having access if you’re murdered, you can say yes to that and no to the others. 

Obviously I’m not a lawyer and the wording would have to be scrutinized from a legal perspective to ensure that ""law enforcement"" was specifically defined, and that this could not be abused by LE, the company, or third parties. But it seems to me that this could be used by people to ensure that if something happens to them (or if they're in a situation where they are afraid something might happen to them, like a person in an abusive relationship), the obstacles that are normally in place for LE to access this information are removed so that LE have this information in the crucial early stages of the investigation.

419,"In the wrong place at the wrong time - The murder in Loviisa, Finland, 2016","Hello! I wanted to try my hand at translating a Finnish true crime case into English.

I'm not a native English speaker, so there will definitely be grammatical oddities here and there, but I did my best with this!

This story is one of those that I just can't get out of my head, and I wanted to share it.

Note: although I know the victim's name (from researching this case, I didn't know her personally), it has never been publicized anywhere, so I will not put it here either. I will refer to her as ""J"", ""the victim"", etc. to avoid revealing her real name.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2013, a then 38 year old woman's dream came true: she bought herself a small farm property in Rikeby, Loviisa, Eastern Uusimaa, Finland.

This woman, J, had been searching for a place where she could live close to nature, in peace and quiet. She wanted to live alone, surrounded only by various animals, such as dogs, horses and chickens.

&amp;#x200B;

Rikeby is a small town area in the middle of countryside near the city of Loviisa. This area and the rather secluded farm were both perfect for J's needs, and she was overjoyed to move there.

This is where she would live with her animals, operate her natural remedy business as well as offer a ""retirement home"" for a few elderly horses. She would also take in abandoned animals, such as a turtle she was caring for.

&amp;#x200B;

Friends and family described J as an earthy, friendly and helpful person.

""She was the world's kindest person, she minded her own business and never bothered anyone"", one friend of hers commented.

&amp;#x200B;

For three years J, now 41 years old, had lived happily at her farm, until in late summer of 2016 it all came to a sudden end.

In the morning of Friday, 5th of August 2016, at around 7 am, J was getting ready to start her day with her usual routine of taking care of her animals. However, the animals would wait for their caretaker in vain.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that same day, at around 18:20 (6:30 pm), a friend of J's came to visit the farm. She was also the owner of one of the elderly horses J was caring for.

Upon getting out of her car, this friend soon made a horrifying discovery on the front yard, near the main building: J's lifeless, bloody corpse was laying on the lawn. She had been hastily covered with a tarp and an upturned wheelbarrow.

&amp;#x200B;

The friend immediately alerted the police of her findings. She also informed them that the victim's car was missing, although she did not know whether the car's absence was linked to the crime, or if J had simply borrowed her car to someone before her death.

A group of police were then told to survey the area and be on the lookout for a car matching the description the victim's friend had given them.

Several hours later a car that matched the description was spotted near the farm. On top of resembling the car they were looking for, the car also caught the police's attention because its license plate was missing.

To this day it is unknown whether the perpetrator took the plate off or if it was removed before for some other reason.

&amp;#x200B;

The police tried to make the suspicious vehicle stop. They flashed their lights at it and eventually used their loudspeaker to command the driver to stop the car. However, the driver ignored them, speeding away, and the situation quickly turned into a dangerous high speed chase. 

&amp;#x200B;

After nearly two hours of being chased by the police, the suspect abandoned the now damaged car in the side of a road near Myrskylä. This road was surrounded by a large and dense forest, and the suspect ran there to hide.

&amp;#x200B;

It was now past midnight, 00:20 (12:20 am), and the forest was dark, visibility was very low. The police tried to find the suspect with flashlights and by staying completely quiet, listening to any sounds of possible movement, but to no avail.

They soon got a police K9 to the scene. It was Börje, a Belgian Malinois. Börje was able to track down the suspect. He was hiding under a tree, positioned as if he was ready to pounce towards anyone who would approach him. He had a knife.

He did not say a word, did not react to anything that was said to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Börje's handler then let the K9 to pursue the suspect, and as Börje bit into him, the suspect stabbed the dog several times. As Börje worked to distract and hold on to the suspect, police were able to approach and disarm him, although he did not let go of the knife until they used both a stun gun and a baton on him.

&amp;#x200B;

Börje got several deep stab wounds to his back and sides. He was rushed to a life-saving surgery and eventually made a full recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

The suspect had been quiet this entire time. As he was being escorted into the police car, he spoke for the first time: ""that dog fucking bit me"", he said.

&amp;#x200B;

\- - -

&amp;#x200B;

The victim had been stabbed fourteen times. Most of these injuries were on the victim's head and neck area.

Some of the wounds were deep puncture type injuries, while others, especially the ones on her neck, were more like slashes.

She had also been dragged around the porch where the murder happened. Overall it was clear that it had been a very violent attack.

The cause of death was determined to be the injuries on the neck arteries.

&amp;#x200B;

\- - -

&amp;#x200B;

The perpetrator is Eetu Erik Skutnabb, who was 28 years old at the time of the murder.

Skutnabb had been institutionalized for his mental health issues for years. He had a violent past, although he had never done anything as serious as this - he had mostly been involved in fights. He was also known to be an alcohol and drug user.

&amp;#x200B;

After one late night fight in a bar, as the police were removing him from scene, they found out he was carrying a knife. When asked about it, he made up a story about being a brickmason and that this particular knife was his work tool.

&amp;#x200B;

Skutnabb was kept in a closed ward, and a risk assessment had been made, classifying him as ""potentially dangerous"". He had ran away several times, and he often only came back when the police brought him days later.

&amp;#x200B;

He was still allowed to go on unsupervised walks, but he had a strict curfew. During one of these walks he once again ran away, and eventually ended up murdering J.

He was missing for four days this time.

There has been criticism of the search efforts and the fact that the public weren't informed about the potentially dangerous runaway patient that was on the move.

&amp;#x200B;

The hospital Skutnabb was kept in and J's farm were in different cities. There was no way Skutnabb ended up there by accident.

And indeed, it was no accident, nor a coincidence. Although J and Skutnabb didn't know each other at all and had never met before, there was still a connection between the two of them: the farm.

&amp;#x200B;

Skutnabb had lived at the farm with his mother and grandmother before it was sold to J some time after he was institutionalized.

For whatever reason, this is where he chose to go.

It took him days to get there. At first he traveled with a bus, until walking the rest of the way.

&amp;#x200B;

On the morning of 5th August, people who were driving to work saw Skutnabb walking along the dirt roads of the Loviisa countryside, towards Rikeby. They paid attention to his rugged appearance and the yellow plastic bag he was carrying. He also behaved strangely, turning his back to each car as it passed, as if trying to conceal his face.

&amp;#x200B;

Only Skutnabb knows what exactly happened once he reached the farm, but due to his mental state he has never been able to provide a coherent explanation of the events and a reason for why he killed the woman. The stories he has told police changed several times during the investigation:

He said that the woman was mean to him for no reason which angered him and made him attack, in another version he claimed that they had an argument which escalated into the attack, but he has also said that there was no real reason for why he did it.

At one point he explained that he thought that the farm still belonged to his family and that the woman must've been an intruder there, which is why he felt he has to attack her to defend his home. However, he later admitted that this was not true and he knew that the farm had been sold years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

The police believe that this was a surprise attack. Skutnabb could have been hiding behind the door on the porch, waiting for someone to come out. As the door opened, he immediately began rapidly stabbing J, who would have had little to no time to react, run away or defend herself before the attacker completely overpowered her and she succumbed to her injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

Skutnabb then dragged J's body off the porch into the yard and covered her. After all this, he stayed at the house for a while. He had been listening to music using J's computer and cooked himself some sort of a meal.

Later that day, just 20 minutes before J's friend showed up,  Skutnabb drove away with the J's car, ""to take care of some business"". It is unknown what he meant by this and what he did during this lengthy car drive until the police spotted him.

&amp;#x200B;

The murder weapon, a large knife, was later found on top of a washing machine. More knives were found in that yellow plastic bag he'd been carrying around.

&amp;#x200B;

The case went to trial, and despite the prosecution's efforts to have him convicted of murder, Skutnabb was ultimately found Not Criminally Responsible. He was institutionalized again, this time to a different facility.

&amp;#x200B;

\- - -

&amp;#x200B;

Although J did not have a spouse nor any children, she had a large family with many siblings who she was in regular contact with and who now miss her dearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Her family struggled with the loss and having to ""take her life apart"" by emptying the farm of her belongings. They also faced financial troubles in the middle of this process.

Selling the farm was very difficult, especially after rumors circulated that Skutnabb had possibly left drugs in the main building, which led to some people breaking in and rummaging the place. The people responsible for this were never caught.

&amp;#x200B;

J's family is saddened and angered by the fact that Skutnabb's life stayed mostly the same although he is a murderer now, while their lives changed forever.

&amp;#x200B;

So there we have it. This case definitely haunts me. I think it's so scary that you can live your life in the middle of nowhere, without any enemies etc., and still get brutally murdered. Just like that, suddenly it's all over for you. And you did nothing wrong.

425,Unforgotten: The Unsolved Murder of Matt Stewart,"Have any of you been listening to the podcast about this case? I am finding the whole thing very frustrating, maybe because I have watched too many episodes of Snapped. I only heard it brought up in one episode that it was huge red flags that the wife ran out of house with just the one child and didn't even seem to mention the other one still in the house for who knows how long. I just feel that the only way a mother would leave her child behind in a house with a gunman is if she knew the child would be safe.

&amp;#x200B;

So many facts are missing in this podcast. Did anyone hear shots? A neighbor dog was barking at something in the woods, but that was 30 minutes before the incident. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like the only reasons we have heard they never looked into her as a suspect was because she seemed upset and she was a good church woman. I am guessing the case files aren't available to the public since it is still an pen case. But I think they need to pass this off to some cold case experts. But most of the family just wants it to go away and is leaving justice up to God. 

&amp;#x200B;

The wife's mother has been threatening the podcaster to stop, because the killer is still out there and could  come after him or the family.

459,Does anyone else feel that there's something's off about the Jodi Arias case?,"I know this is an old case, but I started looking into it again a bit more and a few things are striking me as very, VERY odd. Specifically, the roommates. Now, I have no doubt that Jodi Arias did this - but now I'm having trouble believing that she did this crime all on her lonesome. Are there any explanations for the following things? :

1. How is it possible that the roommates didn't smell anything at all? I understand that smells can gradually move especially in such a big house, but it's not likely that they stayed in one corner of the house for nearly a week, and the smell of decomposition is, well...putrid

2. TA's dog..they knew how much he loved her, and all of the sudden they just believe he got up and left for vacation without leaving any food or water for his dog? Did the dog really not act strangely at all?

3. How the hell did the roommates not go to or near his bathroom or the washing machine for FIVE DAYS? Why would Jodi even feel comfortable placing the bloodied clothes and the camera in there knowing that he didn't live alone, why didn't she take it with her? In fact why would she even feel so comfortable committing the crime there in the first place, shouldn't she have been worried about being caught by them?

4. Why was there a smell of cigarette smoke in the rental car when it was returned, considering it was proven that Jodi doesn't smoke?

5. How did Jodi not end up with more injuries, and furthermore is it really probable that she could've incapacitated this man all by herself? I'm having trouble believing she overpowered him all on her own. 

6. What's up with the notes that the police found trying to be smuggled through the prison? The thing about how she fucked up and told the attorneys something she wasn't supposed to..?

7. The roommates were oddly calm when calling 911. I completely understand the concept of someone being in shock, but..I don't know. It just seems so off when added with all of these other things. 

Idk..what do you guys think?

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that I find it odd how his beloved dog was left unattended and left downstairs blocked by a stair gate. Apparently, the upstairs light that is usually turned off was on for the entire 5 days..AND they never thought to check properly upstairs for the entire 5 days when they were frantically texting each other, wondering why he hadn't arrived in Cancun?

Months prior to the attack, the maid had quit due to hearing strange sounds around the house, and her believing it was haunted. Then in the days leading up to the murders, more strange occurrences happened; footprints in the snow leading from the woods to the house, but none leading back, keys going missing, and a random newspapers showing up.   
Then, on March 31, the 5 members of the Gruber family and their maid (who was on the first day of the job) were bludgeoned to death. Today, almost 100 year later, the killer and the motive is still unknown.  
I cover this case in my newest video:

First I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion. I think the mother handled this poorly from the word go. I agree that a 20 year old should not be having sex with a 14 year old, but dragging your daughter down to the police station and forcing a rape kit on her to prove to yourself that they are having sex?!?! Rape kits are extremely hard to undertake when you consented due to rape, let alone an unwanted one. Also just assuming the boy is gone so the issues that resulted in her having sex so young instead of therapy and family therapy to help that bond be built back is insane to me.

523,Opinions on the Dee Dee Blanchard case?,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder\_of\_Dee\_Dee\_Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Dee_Dee_Blanchard)

&amp;#x200B;

The case has recently fascinated me in the past month or so. I'm guessing most of you are familiar with the case but for those who aren't, it's chronicled in a HBO Documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest

[Link to Full Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM51NteUeFo&amp;t=882s)

It's also the subject of a tv show on Hulu coming out later this month.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the daughter Gypsy and her boyfriend Nick, who she met online, killed her mom. The mom had Munchausen by proxy, and basically convinced everybody including her daughter that she was very very ill and had her in a wheelchair, had a feeding tube installed, had her on all this medication and even had multiple surgeries preformed on her that she didn't need. She was also physically abusive to Gypsy and forced her into silence and to comply with what every she told her to.

&amp;#x200B;

Gypsy ended up taking a plea deal and was sentence to 10 years in prison. Nick pleaded not guilty and ended up  going to trial and did end up getting life in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen various opinions on this. Many people think that Gypsy shouldn't be in jail at all and was the victim in all of this. I've seen some who think that she took advantage of Nick who had autism himself. There are people who insist she could have reached out to someone for help. Also there comes the question of all the doctors who failed her and prescribed medication and preformed surgeries for conditions that didn't exist and feel Gypsy's father should investigate and sue them.

&amp;#x200B;

**My opinion:** I honestly think she does deserve some time in prison since this was a murder that was clearly pre meditated but I also think she would have never gone through with it if she had never met Nick who seemed to have deep issues. It's unfortunate that he is the person who she found in her loneliness but I guess damaged people people are drawn to one another. I also think she was failed by many people, including her father and the many, many doctors that her mom took her to see.. I just hope while she is in jail she is getting the help that she need which apparently the Chillicothe Correctional Center, where she is staying doesn't provide.",1,29,"Opinions on the Dee Dee Blanchard case?

530,Cold Case Rachael Johnson Murder,"In 1991, Rachael Johnson left an Akron nightclub with a friend and headed home. She would never make it. After the friend's car got a flat tire and the interior filled with the smell of burning rubber, she insisted on finding her own way home. She got out of her friend's car - and was picked up by a killer. Her body was found that morning, raped, beaten, stabbed and set afire in the middle of a street.
Special guests: Katelin Puzakulics, who was two years old when her mother was murdered, and Lesli Rarick, the woman who is trying to help her shed new light on a cold case.

541,"I have a question about the identity of a murderer, but I don't remember many details.","Hello. 

To begin with, I'm sorry if I shouldn't post this here, but I think this might be the best place to do so. The murderer I'm looking for is special because he was alive a couple or more centuries ago (but if I had to make a bet on it I'd say he existed in the XIX century) and he has an interesting story. I'll state the facts I'm the most sure about first:

1. He got arrested for murder but he ended up helping the (local?) police with their affairs, thus being a real murderer who acted as a detective.
2. Due to his status as a detective, his name forms part of a real (but I don't remember if active) detective association/mystery-solving associaton's name. I'm sure of this because this was what lead me to look up this person and his story struck me. I also was not aware of the existence of detective associations and I'm almost sure it was constituted by detective aficionados. 

Now the facts I'm not so sure about but I'm very positive on them:

1. He might've been a homeless person.
2. He was somewhat impetuous, and if I recall correctly, got often involved into fights. I clearly remember he got into duels and that he was challenged for one by a man, whom he ended up killing in the act (well, that's what duels are)
3. He was European or American. If he was European, he most likely lived in the UK and less likely in France. If he was American, he most certainly lived in USA.

549,Why are they being Protected?,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if you have seen this article on MSN news, recently about the Bulger killers, but I thought I would share it.

[https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/james-bulger-court-rejects-bid-from-murdered-toddlers-father-to-reveal-details-about-killer/ar-BBUlTLb?li=BBoPWjQ&amp;ocid=mailsignout](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/james-bulger-court-rejects-bid-from-murdered-toddlers-father-to-reveal-details-about-killer/ar-BBUlTLb?li=BBoPWjQ&amp;ocid=mailsignout)

&amp;#x200B;

The gist of it is James' father Randy is trying to have one of them named. It's blowing my mind that these two are still being protected, despite both of them leaking their identities before, both of them convicted of having child pornography on their computers and both claiming to be paedophiles and proud of it.

&amp;#x200B;

One of them is engaged with a baby, from that article (which I can't find now) it was stated his fiancee was aware of who he was. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both breached bail conditions which included returning to the areas they are from and where James was murdered.

&amp;#x200B;

The cost of protecting these vile monsters will cost taxpayers millions, yet we still don't have a choice whether or not we want to pay taxes, which to me, should be voluntary for this very reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what your thoughts are on this and apologies if you have already seen it, but I suppose I'm just wanting to vent my frustrations and Twitter only has 132 characters (or whatever it is).

&amp;#x200B;

When will the line be drawn? When will an official say enough is enough and name them? Why are they being protected for killing a child? They would be in their 30's now so no longer minors, yet they're still being protected whilst continuing to break the law and for all we know abusing and hurting other children.",1,16,"Why are they being Protected?

556,Already trying to end genetic genealogy,"Something that I'm disappointed, but not necessarily surprised, about. Similar to the argument against surveillance cameras, the argument about ""invasion of privacy"" is being made to try and stop the use of genetic genealogy to track down criminals.

&gt;[House Bill 30, introduced by Sydnor in January, says](http://www.mgaleg.maryland.gov/2019RS/bills/hb/hb0030f.pdf),  ""Each DNA record of identification characteristics that results from  DNA testing under this subtitle shall be stored and maintained only by  the Crime Laboratory in the statewide DNA data base system, except as  necessary to participate in CODIS \[the law enforcement database\].""   
&gt;  
&gt;""A person may not perform a search of the statewide DNA data base or any  other DNA or genealogical database for the purpose of identification of  an offender in connection with a crime for which the offender may be a  biological relative of the individual from whom the DNA sample was  acquired,"" the bill said.   
&gt;  
&gt;Vera Eidelman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), understands the public's concern. 

 

&gt;To Eidelman, law enforcement's use of genetic genealogy in cold case murders and sex assaults is a slippery slope.   
&gt;  
&gt;""I can only imagine how this will expand to other sorts of crimes,"" she  said. ""Right now we're discussing this in the context of cold murder and  rape cases, but I wonder what will stop law enforcement from using  similar investigative techniques to go after trespassers or purse  snatchers."" 

&amp;#x200B;

597,Billy Boyette and Mary Rice Murder Spree,"On January 31, 2017 Billy Boyette killed 2 women in a motel in Milton, Florida.  The women were his ex-girlfriend, Alicia Greer, and her friend Jacqueline Moore.  Boyette shot them and then went on the run with current girlfriend, Mary Rice.  

&amp;#x200B;

Mary Rice went into stores buying items to help Boyette including pre-paid phone cards and ammunition.  She's even seen on Wal Mart surveillance footage looking at cosmetics.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 3, the evil duo followed Peggy Broz from her work to her home in Lillian, Alabama.  They shot and killed her to take her car, which was found abandoned a day later.  With murder victims in 2 states, authorities began a manhunt that included local, state and federal law enforcement.  The local news stations kept the area on alert and aware of reported sightings.  

&amp;#x200B;

On February 6, Boyette and Rice broke into Kayla Crocker's home in Beulah, Florida.  They tied her up, yanked out clumps of her hair, and shot her before fleeing with the contents of her jewelry box and her car.  Her 18 month old son was home during the robbery and shooting.  Kayla Crocker died from her injuries the next day.  

&amp;#x200B;

The pair of criminals was able to flee into Georgia, and authorities found them at the West Point Motel in Troupe County, Georgia.  There a standoff occurred.  Billy Boyette killed himself with his gun, and Mary Rice turned herself in.  Mary Rice was charged with Accessory After the Fact to Murder, Double Homicide of Greer and Moore, and First Degree Murder of Crocker.  She was found guilty of all charges.  

&amp;#x200B;

So much went on during this case!  Schools were on lockdown, the Escambia County (Florida) Sheriff warned residents to be aware their personal safety.  He made threats to Boyette during a press conference.  Information was released that both Greer and Rice had been victims of domestic violence committed by Boyette.  Mary Rice's willingness to participate in the crimes was questioned at trial due to the abuse.  

&amp;#x200B;

We host a podcast and just released an episode on the Boyette case.  It's a multi-part series to allow us to share interviews we did with both a trial witness and the US Marshal in charge of the fugitive hunt.  One thing we were surprised about was the lack of national coverage this case received.  What makes some crimes ""front page"" news and a topic for ID Channel documentaries, and how do other cases fade into obscurity?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are links to a few of our local news stories on the case:

599,"Shankill Butchera, Northern Irish serial killers","Anyone ever heard of them before?

""The Shankill Butchers was an Ulster loyalist gang—many of whom were members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)—that was active between 1975 and 1982 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was based in the Shankill area and was responsible for the deaths of at least 23 people, most of whom were killed in sectarian attacks. The gang was notorious for kidnapping and murdering random Catholic and suspected Catholic civilians; each was beaten ferociously and had his throat hacked with a butcher's knife. Some were also tortured and attacked with a hatchet. The gang also killed six Ulster Protestants over personal disputes, and two other Protestants mistaken for Catholics.

Most of the gang were eventually caught and, in February 1979, received the longest combined prison sentences in United Kingdom legal history. However, gang leader Lenny Murphy and his two chief ""lieutenants"" escaped prosecution. Murphy was murdered in November 1982 by the Provisional IRA, likely acting with loyalist paramilitaries who perceived him as a threat.[1] The Butchers brought a new level of paramilitary violence to a country already hardened by death and destruction.[2] The judge who oversaw the 1979 trial described their crimes as ""a lasting monument to blind sectarian bigotry"".

620,Who killed Charles Collins? (Ashtabula train disaster),"Charles Collins - the man for whom the Cleveland neighborhood of Collinwood was named - was one of the best railroad construction engineers in the country, and helped bring rail service to northern Ohio. But history books still say his death was suicide caused by guilt over a bridge failure in which nearly 100 people plummeted to a firey death in Ashtabula.
What people didn't know for a century was that a second, secret autopsy conducted by a pair of medical college professors decided it wasn't suicide. Collins had been murdered. [Ohio Mysteries](http://www.ohiomysteries.com)

",1,1,"Who killed Charles Collins? (Ashtabula train disaster) Charles Collins - the man for whom the Cleveland neighborhood of Collinwood was named - was one of the best railroad construction engineers in the country, and helped bring rail service to northern Ohio. But history books still say his death was suicide caused by guilt over a bridge failure in which nearly 100 people plummeted to a firey death in Ashtabula. What people didn't know for a century was that a second, secret autopsy conducted by a pair of medical college professors decided it wasn't suicide. Collins had been murdered.

627,The Boy Who Snapped: A Quintuple Murder in Albuquerque,"The Griego family was a normal clan. 51-year-old Greg was a pastor and chaplain, and his wife, 40-year-old Sarah Griego lived with their two sons: Nehemiah, 15, and Zephaniah, 9, and two daughters: Jael, 5, and Angelina, 2, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. To outsiders they looked like the normal, all-American family. They were devout Christians and their church life was the center of everything they did. They never saw it coming. 

Just a few minutes after midnight on January 19, 2013, Nehemiah loaded the AR-15 he'd stolen out of his parents' closet and carried it to his parents' bedroom. Inside was his mother, Sarah, sleeping alone while his father was out of the house. He shot her in the face, killing her instantly. 

Zephaniah heard the shots and woke up. Nehemiah greeted him by telling him that he'd just killed their mother. Zephaniah didn't believe him, and so Nehemiah took him to his parents' bedroom and showed him the bloody scene. When Zephaniah reacted, he was shot and killed as well. 

The racket of the shootings had woken Nehemiah's sisters. He heard them crying in their shared bedroom, so he went upstairs and shot them both in the head at point-blank range.

After these first few minutes of carnage, Nehemiah went back downstairs and sat down on the couch with his gun in his lap. He waited five hours for his father to arrive home from his shift ministering to residents of a homeless shelter. As soon as Greg stepped inside the door, he was shot several times and killed instantly. He never stood a chance. 

Earlier in the evening, Nehemiah had loaded the family van with ammunition. He planned to shoot up the local Walmart after wiping out his entire family. His goal was to kill as many people as he could before committing suicide by cop. 

By dawn, Nehemiah had changed his mind. Instead of shooting up Walmart, he went to church. He wandered around the church's campus for a little while before he ran into the church's director of security, Vince Harrison. Nehemiah was described as robotic in his demeanor, and during their conversation, he confessed to the murders. 

""When I met Nehemiah, I knew something wasn’t right,"" Harrison said. ""I could feel it, I could see it in his eyes and I could see it in his behavior and his demeanor, so the red flags went up and that’s when I called the sheriff’s department.""

Police rushed to the family's home and found the ugly scene of carnage.  Nehemiah Griego was arrested and taken to the local police station. Nehemiah calmly laid out the entire timeline of events. He described the execution of his parents and siblings matter-of-factly, like he was relaying the plot of a movie. The only time he showed any emotion was when he talked about his favorite video games: Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto. He said that his motive for the crime was that he was frustrated with his mother. He gave no explanation for killing his father and siblings. 

Nehemiah Griego was a bright boy and a talented musician. He played guitar, drums and bass with the church choir and was a wrestler at school. He had plenty of friends and wasn't a loner in any sense of the word. 

After Nehemiah's arrest, the only question was whether he would be tried as a juvenile or an adult. If he was tried as a juvenile, he would be held into his 20s. If he was tried as an adult, he would be facing 120 years in prison. 

The case remained at a standstill for three years while Nehemiah underwent several psychiatric evaluations while in juvenile detention. In October 2015, Nehemiah officially pled guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and three counts of child abuse causing death. On February 11, 2016, Judge John J. Romero of the New Mexico Children's Court ruled that Nehemiah was amenable to treatment and would therefore be sentenced in juvenile court. 

Just a couple of months after his sentencing, a guard at the juvenile prison where Nehemiah was being held was arrested for having sex with the then-19 year old. After turning 21, Nehemiah was transferred from juvenile prison to the Bernalillo County Detention Center to await his amenability hearing. While there, he was written up for having sex with a fellow inmate, which could potentially result in a criminal charge if he is released. 

On December 3, 2018, Nehemiah Griego's amenability hearing was held. As Nehemiah sat at the defense table in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffs, and shackles, prosecutors showed the judge graphic crime scene photos and begged him to resentence Nehemiah as an adult. Under New Mexico law, if the juvenile is not rehabilitated at age 21 after serving time in juvenile detention, the defendant can be resentenced to adult time. 

So far the judge has not made his decision, and it may take another few months for his decision to be announced.

632,Alberto Sánchez (26) kills his own mother (66) and eats her corpse.,"Hello, this is my very first post. So here's my contribution. It happened a few days ago in Spain, this young man was caught by police while he was hiding his mother's body, her name was Soledad. He had dismemebered her corpse one month ago, during that time he cooked and consumed her rests with the help of his dog. It's a really horrible crime that has disturbed Spanish society since Spain is mostly a safe country. The last time I heard about such disgusting murder in this country was many years ago (the katana killer, José Rabadán). He was dealing with severe mental illness and drug abuse. Not much is known about his life but we will learn more details soon.

636,The Murder of WA teen: Ben Eastman,"&amp;#x200B;

[Ben Eastman](https://i.redd.it/heaz38wmjsi21.jpg)

This story makes me so sick to my stomach... A Washington 16 year-old boy was murdered and sexually assaulted by his best friend in June of 2018. The killers, Benito “Benny” Marquez, also 16, and Benny's 21-year-old brother, Jonathon Adamson, left Ben Eastman's lifeless body in a shallow grave marked with a DIY cross made out of sticks. 

Eastman had been lured out by an invitation to go on a ""guy's camping trip"" with Marquez and Adamson, and when Eastman accepted the offer, the brothers spent ""20 to 45 minutes"" beating and kicking him over 100 times, then bludgeoned him to death with a large rock. Court documents allege that Ben had also been raped and assaulted with a stick while still alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Jonathon Adamson \(left\) and Benito \\""Benny\\"" Marquez \(right\)](https://i.redd.it/35xqx8qtlsi21.jpg)

While citizens and police of Randle, Washington were searching for Eastman, Marquez posted a Facebook status that said, ""Please if you hear anything about him or where he’s at notify Bj Eastman \[his father\] and send prayers out for his family."" Then the two brothers took off and were pulled over and arrested 120 miles away from home, where they confessed to the murder of Eastman. 

While no motive has been released by authorities, it was known in town that Eastman was dating Marquez's sister, and that the killing could have stemmed from an argument about their involvement. And while nothing has been proven, several comments made by classmates insisted that Marquez and the sister shared a weird brother/sister relationship and that they think the murder stemmed from jealousy.

659,Can we get some eyes on this?,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/DanielHoltzclaw](https://www.reddit.com/r/DanielHoltzclaw)

This is a pretty crazy case with a lot of insane shit happening. I can't come to any conclusions 100% but with DNA experts and many other experts coming out of the woodworks to defend this guy and bring light to the case, I figured I would share it here.

At the very least, this case was mishandled SEVERELY. Really, really, really severely mishandled. Pretty much a fucking mockery.

For instance, the DNA analyst they used, she flat out refused to do saliva tests on his pants, even though many of the allegations centered around him forcing oral sex.

There's also video evidence (from his own interrogation) of detectives handling his clothing barehanded and reaching into the evidence bag many times barehanded.

Every bit of it looks bad.

There's so much more about this case I can't even begin to condense into this post. It's very much worth looking into.  


EDIT: Here's a real kicker: one of the women he was CONVICTED of raping, she told the detectives SEVEN times she was never assaulted by anyone. They had to keep pressuring her and pressuring her to get an allegation.  


Another victim? Said her attacker was a short, dark skinned man. Not a 6ft Asian man. She even failed to identify Holtzclaw in a lineup, which the detectives abandoned when they couldn't get the victims to pick out Holtzclaw (internal emails that have been released show this).",1,10,"Can we get some eyes on this?

672,Researching Cases - Any Recommendations?,"Hey!

I am doing a report for school on specific types of cases. I am looking for cases that were solved because of the determination of someone connected to the case to find justice.

For example, the case of the murder of Judith Johnson. Clarence Elkins was identified as the murderer by his 5-year-old niece (who witnessed the murder) and was convicted. Eight years later, all thanks to the tireless work of his wife Molly, his innocence was proven and someone else was convicted of the murder. Molly KNEW he was innocent and wouldn't stop her quest for justice, even when Police had given up.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence\_Elkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Elkins)

Another example is the murder of Uta Von Schwedler. She was found dead in her bathtub, in what appeared to be a suicide. She left quite a sizeable inheritance to her son. Her son found the circumstances of his mother's death suspicious and poured money towards further investigation, and eventually hired the legal team that made sure his murdering father ended up in jail.

732,"The Case of Pamela Sue Rimer- April 28, 1966","&amp;#x200B;

On April 28th, 1966, the body of Pamela Sue Rimer, an eighteen year-old high school honors student, was discovered in a wooded area near her home in Luthersburg, Pennsylvania.

On the morning of April 29th 1966, a teacher at Dubois Area Senior High, rang the doorbell of the local police station. Sources say he states, ""I am the man you are looking for.” So, the officer asked if he was speaking of the “Incident in Luthersburg,” and the man confirmed.

The officer woke the detective and a fellow police officer and informed them that, “There was a man in the front that said we are looking for him.” When the officer returned, the man removed his coat and gloves and identified himself as Jon Yount. The officer and the detective entered the front office and began to speak with Yount. The detective asked, “Why are we looking for you?”

Yount replied, “I killed that girl.” “What girl?”

“Pamela Rimer.”

[Jon Yount](https://i.redd.it/2q64eh67ndh21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Pamela Sue Rimer was last seen alive on the afternoon of April 28th, 1966. The girl was later found with one of her stockings tied around her neck, had been raped.  An autopsy revealed that her death was caused by strangulation, she had three slashes across her throat, cuts of the fingers on her left hand, numerous wounds on her head, caused by a blunt instrument. The blunt instrument was confirmed to be a wrench by Jon Yount during his interrogation with police when he stated, ""I hit her with a wrench and I choked her."" Yount also said that he was in the area looking for property when he saw Pamela Sue walking home from the bus stop. He said he offered his student a ride. He testified that he made an innocent comment that she misinterpreted as an advance, and tried to get out of the car, threatening to report him to authorities.

&amp;#x200B;

Jon Yount was convicted of first-degree murder, was given life in prison after his confession. For twenty years, Yount was a model prisoner, even playing organ for the choir, learning computer programming, and teaching in the prison's school. Until, he began speaking with Diane Brodbeck. Diane was a 43 year old woman who was actively involved in church, was happily married to her husband, Chester of 23 years. Together they had two daughters. Diane was very active in her community and at the time, one activity was to write to a prisoner who had no family or friends. In 1982, she began writing to Jon Yount, after her friend could no longer write to him.

[Diane Brodbeck](https://i.redd.it/phnc9anlndh21.jpg)

After Yount and Diane wrote for several months, she began visiting him. Later, Yount would be transferred to Rockview prison, which was two hours away from Diane, but she would continue visiting him. Walter Regel, the corrections officer at the prison, reported that Diane would visit once a week, he believed the two were boyfriend and girlfriend because they were regularly seen kissing and hugging during the visits. Although her family, friends were unaware, Diane had fallen in love with the killer, Jon Yount.

[Jon Yount](https://i.redd.it/zd74x6ujndh21.jpg)

In February, 1985 Yount wrote a letter to Diane saying he was planning an escape  after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his request for a new trial. As stated before, Yount was a model prisoner, meaning he was allowed to work outside of prison grounds, unsupervised. On the morning of April 5th, 1986, Yount vanished after going outside to cut hay.

Officer Regel was driving to a bowling alley when he saw Diane driving towards the prison, which would be the last time Diane was seen. That day, Diane and Jon Yount both vanished.

Diane had told her husband, Chester that she was going to Williamsburg, Virgina for the weekend. When she had not returned, he realized that she had definitely escaped with Yount. To further prove this, authorities discovered that Diane had opened a secret bank account and withdrew $7,500 in the weeks prior to her disappearance, had placed a car in a storage facility two weeks before. On the night of April 4th, the couple had spoke for 14 minutes on the phone. Due to the evidence found by authorities, they decided to file charges against Diane for assisting Yount.

Everyone who knew Diane couldn't believe that she would help Yount. A month after the escape, her car was found abandoned at a motel just twenty miles from her home. A bag was found in the trunk which contained several personal items, including jewelry, cosmetics, and underwear. Many were left to theorize until the case was featured as a part of Special #7 on May 18, 1988 on Unsolved Mysteries. There was also an episode about Yount's crime in season 1 episode 3 of Unsolved Mysteries.

After the broadcast, Diane Brodbeck and Jon Yount were found living in Boise, Idaho under assumed names as two viewers recognized Diane, who had been using the name ""Cathy Kermin"" and had been working as a bank manager. Yount was working as a computer programmer, making use of the skill he learned during his prison sentence.

After a month-long investigation, the couple was arrested in their homes. Diane served two years in prison for helping Yount escape and has since been released. Diane wishes she would have never been an accomplice to the man who killed  his young student.  Jon Yount was returned to prison. Yount later committed suicide while in prison in April 2012, just three days before the 46 year anniversary of his brutal crime.

[Yount after capture](https://i.redd.it/yeohzrprndh21.jpg)

Even 21 years after Rimer's death, her mother, LaVonne Rimer, cried when speaking about her daughter. Her only other child was killed in a farm accident in 1963 at age 10. His name was Douglas Jr.  'I have nothing, no children, no grandchildren. No one calls me to say, ""How are you Mom?"" My life is over since then,' she said.  The woman's life was filled with grief as her husband preceded in death in 1976.  'What he did just didn't end my daughter's life; it ended my life and my husband's life,' she told the Collegian. Rimer still vividly remembered the day she pointed out the big tree, where Pamela Sue, lying face down, drowned in her own blood. She believed her daughter ran from Yount and was cutting through the woods to try to reach the main road when he caught up with her. Sadly, she was only a quarter-mile away from her home.  Rimer's mother believed that Yount had been waiting for a chance to catch her daughter on the road, as Pamela Sue had reported to her mother that she had seen Yount drive by the house on several previous afternoons. She also asked if she could transfer out of Yount's advanced math class, saying, ""Oh, Mom, you should see his eyes."" LaVonne Rimer passed away on May 13, 2010, at DuBois (PA) Regional Medical Center following a short illness.

Rimer was only 18 years old when she was killed by her high school algebra teacher. But, she should be remembered for more than just being a victim to a murder. Pamela lived in Luthersburg from the time she was born, growing up there. She was an honors student, was planning to enroll at Pennsylvania State University. Pamela played the clarinet in the school band and rode horses. Sadly, Pamela Sue was killed soon before her senior prom, because of this, she was buried wearing the prom dress she had picked out, directly before her unfortunate death. Students also placed their graduation tassels on her grave.  Let this be a reminder, to stay safe, as you never know what may be just around the corner, or, what never will be again.

733,Was there some strategy to Jeffrey MacDonald's failure to file briefs on time during his 2014 appeals to the 4th circuit court?,"This isn't about his guilt or innocence. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's about the fact that MacDonald and his defense lawyers missed something like seven deadlines for submitting an informal brief for his appeal (#14-7543) for additional DNA testing related to his convictions for murdering his family in 1970. 

Finally, after ten months and numerous requests for extensions to complete what turned out to be a two-page document (plus an index), his brief was submitted an hour past what was supposed to be the final deadline. There's more, but I just want to know why. Was he trying to delay things until new DNA technology could be developed? Is he simply putting off the inevitable to keep the tiniest of hopes for freedom alive until he dies of old age?  Or is this just the common rigamarole that keeps the US courts constantly behind schedule?

I know a lot of you have strong opinions about whether he's guilty or not, but I don't need to hear them. Please don't turn this into a vehicle for your arguments about whether or not he killed his wife and children. I'm asking for thoughts related to his legal strategy, if there is one.

A lady was found dead in her house from gun shot wounds, she also had a bite mark on her. They thought it was a burglary gone wrong because of some VCRS unplugged on the floor..(but no jewelry or cash was missing). The parents of Sherri told police 15 times that an ex-gf of her husband showed up at her work telling her ""if I can't have him, nobody can.."" as well as confronting Sherri in her house(after breaking in) weeks earlier... The detectives dismissed this because the ex of Sherri's husband was a cop/detective... The only thing missing from the house was Sherri's car and her marriage license... And the cops dismiss the info about the crazy ex-girlfriend??? Thats fucking insane.. Do detectives even care about solving these cases??? THE EVIDENCE was staring them in the face and it took 20+ years later and a guy reopening it as a cold case to solve it.. I COULD HAVE SOLVED THIS.. That lady has had 25 extra years to have a family and a child which she shouldn't have had.. She should have been in prison. Extremely aggravating and it angers me greatly. The DNA from the bite on Sherri was a match to the ex of her husband(the cop lady) and she was convicted at trial and sentenced to 27 years to life, she is eligible for parole in 2039. I am glad justice was served but it angers me greatly that it took 26 years due to extreme negligence.

Edit: as for some other evidence, the day of the murder Detective Lazarus(the ex-gf) wasn't working, the caliber of the bullets that killed Sherri were the same as the one that Lazarus's off duty service weapon used, which she reported stolen 2 weeks after the murder(what a coincidence)... and the DNA matched the bite mark.

838,Just need to get this off my chest.,"I think my in law is a serial child molester or serial killer. 

So when I first started dating my current boyfriend I couldn't understand why my family hated his stepfather we will call him Jeff. One day I asked my grandparents why they didn't like him and they told me that when he was a part of their Church years ago there were rumors spreading around that he was being inappropriate with the young boys there. But whatever I didn't believe them so I went and asked my mom what's up with everyone hating my in-law while she told me that when I was about 1 years old her and her current boyfriend at the time you should go over to Jeff's house and he used to have young boys spend the night there which didn't seem right to my mom or anyone else so that threw me off. I told my boyfriend all of this information and about a year later he came out and told me that he actually had been molested by Jeff multiple times when he was around 13 years old. 

So before all of this my boyfriend was about 17 years old when his father and Jeff decided to up and leave move out of state across the country and it was all due to seasonal depression and anxiety from his father? They were  leaving 3 young adult sons and their entire family randomly. 

So the first time my boyfriend and I went to visit his father and Jeff  itwas actually the first time I ever met Jeff (this is prior to the knowledge that he molested children) I remember my first thought of him was he gives me creepy Vibes and also he looked a lot like the BTK killer I remember sending my boyfriend a photo of the BTK Killer and saying look at the similarities.

I hated that every night we stayed he wanted to watch horror gory bloody movies I never have been a fan. 

He would laugh and joke about all of the animals he'd recently shot off their back porch and  that also made me very uncomfortable due to the fact that they were in a pretty big neighborhood. 

Almost every night he would go into this room and play games until like the super early hours in the morning when everyone was asleep and it was just really weird. 

The whole trip was odd. 

Fast forward to the second time we visited his father and Jeff, my boyfriend had just told me about Jeff molested him when he was younger a few months prior to this and so we had this knowledge going there and we weren't planning on saying anything because the molestation that happened about 10 years prior so we couldn't do anything anyways. Either way my boyfriend was feeling a lot more confident and feeling a lot more hatred toward Jeff and so we decided to just kind of Torment him in a sense and bring up pedophiles and the current pedophilia crimes going on right now and every single time we brought it up jef would deter the conversation right away he did not want to talk about anything having to do with pedophiles it was just so strange. 

Every time I've ever seen him around young boys too he always will try to make that boy the center of attention even in a room full of people will try to engage him in deep conversation or bring up things he knows the boy wants to talk about.


These are just random details I've noticed over the years- 

Jeff's mom is the type of person to see something horrible and then ask if you want a slice of cake I've witnessed this. 

Jeff is super smart and very knowledgeable on a lot of things he went from carrying drugs across state borders when he was young boy to a youth pastor to working for Hospital computers and now works at in an i.t department. He will talk your ear off about anything and everything. 

Another really strange fact is how he can stare my boyfriend in the face with seemegly clueless smile and he knows my boyfriend remembers Jeff molesting him you can just tell it's very thick tension. He will just carry on normal conversation with my boyfriend as if nothing has ever happened or he's convinced itself it hasn't or something I don't know it's just kind of sickening and seems as if he's got some type of disorder. 

There are so many more small details that I missing in this I know it for sure but I'm telling you there is something so strange about this guy.

\#childmolester \#serialkiller",1,16,"Just need to get this off my chest. I think my in law is a serial child molester or serial killer.   So when I first started dating my current boyfriend I couldn't understand why my family hated his stepfather we will call him Jeff. One day I asked my grandparents why they didn't like him and they told me that when he was a part of their Church years ago there were rumors spreading around that he was being inappropriate with the young boys there. But whatever I didn't believe them so I went and asked my mom what's up with everyone hating my in-law while she told me that when I was about 1 years old her and her current boyfriend at the time you should go over to Jeff's house and he used to have young boys spend the night there which didn't seem right to my mom or anyone else so that threw me off. I told my boyfriend all of this information and about a year later he came out and told me that he actually had been molested by Jeff multiple times when he was around 13 years old.   So before all of this my boyfriend was about 17 years old when his father and Jeff decided to up and leave move out of state across the country and it was all due to seasonal depression and anxiety from his father? They were  leaving 3 young adult sons and their entire family randomly.   So the first time my boyfriend and I went to visit his father and Jeff  itwas actually the first time I ever met Jeff (this is prior to the knowledge that he molested children) I remember my first thought of him was he gives me creepy Vibes and also he looked a lot like the BTK killer I remember sending my boyfriend a photo of the BTK Killer and saying look at the similarities.  I hated that every night we stayed he wanted to watch horror gory bloody movies I never have been a fan.   He would laugh and joke about all of the animals he'd recently shot off their back porch and  that also made me very uncomfortable due to the fact that they were in a pretty big neighborhood.   Almost every night he would go into this room and play games until like the super early hours in the morning when everyone was asleep and it was just really weird.   The whole trip was odd.   Fast forward to the second time we visited his father and Jeff, my boyfriend had just told me about Jeff molested him when he was younger a few months prior to this and so we had this knowledge going there and we weren't planning on saying anything because the molestation that happened about 10 years prior so we couldn't do anything anyways. Either way my boyfriend was feeling a lot more confident and feeling a lot more hatred toward Jeff and so we decided to just kind of Torment him in a sense and bring up pedophiles and the current pedophilia crimes going on right now and every single time we brought it up jef would deter the conversation right away he did not want to talk about anything having to do with pedophiles it was just so strange.   Every time I've ever seen him around young boys too he always will try to make that boy the center of attention even in a room full of people will try to engage him in deep conversation or bring up things he knows the boy wants to talk about.   These are just random details I've noticed over the years-   Jeff's mom is the type of person to see something horrible and then ask if you want a slice of cake I've witnessed this.   Jeff is super smart and very knowledgeable on a lot of things he went from carrying drugs across state borders when he was young boy to a youth pastor to working for Hospital computers and now works at in an i.t department. He will talk your ear off about anything and everything.   Another really strange fact is how he can stare my boyfriend in the face with seemegly clueless smile and he knows my boyfriend remembers Jeff molesting him you can just tell it's very thick tension. He will just carry on normal conversation with my boyfriend as if nothing has ever happened or he's convinced itself it hasn't or something I don't know it's just kind of sickening and seems as if he's got some type of disorder.   There are so many more small details that I missing in this I know it for sure but I'm telling you there is something so strange about this guy.  \#childmolester \#serialkiller",need get chest think law serial child molester serial killer first started dating current boyfriend understand family hated stepfather call jeff one day asked grandparent told wa part church year ago rumor spreading around wa inappropriate young boy whatever believe went asked mom everyone hating law told wa year old current boyfriend time go jeff house used young boy spend night seem right mom anyone else threw told boyfriend information year later came told actually molested jeff multiple time wa around year old boyfriend wa year old father jeff decided leave move state across country wa due seasonal depression anxiety father leaving young adult son entire family randomly first time boyfriend went visit father jeff itwas actually first time ever met jeff prior knowledge molested child remember first thought wa give creepy vibe also looked lot btk killer remember sending boyfriend photo btk killer saying look similarity hated every night stayed wanted watch horror gory bloody movie never fan would laugh joke animal recently shot back porch also made uncomfortable due fact pretty big neighborhood almost every night would go room play game super early hour morning everyone wa asleep wa really weird whole trip wa odd fast forward second time visited father jeff boyfriend told jeff molested wa younger month prior knowledge going planning saying anything molestation happened year prior anything anyways either way boyfriend wa feeling lot confident feeling lot hatred toward jeff decided kind torment sense bring pedophile current pedophilia going right every single time brought jef would deter conversation right away want talk anything pedophile wa strange every time ever seen around young boy always try make boy center attention even room full people try engage deep conversation bring thing boy want talk random detail noticed year jeff mom type person see something horrible ask want slice cake witnessed jeff super smart knowledgeable lot thing went carrying drug across state border wa young boy youth pastor working hospital computer work department talk ear anything everything another really strange fact stare boyfriend face seemegly clueless smile boyfriend remembers jeff molesting tell thick tension carry normal conversation boyfriend nothing ha ever happened convinced something kind sickening seems got type disorder many small detail missing sure telling something strange guy childmolester serialkiller,need get chest

844,The Montecasino Murder,"Not sure if anyone is aware of this case as if happened in Johannesburg, South Africa. The victim was a friend of mine, we’d lost contact over the years but we stayed up to date on each others lives on Facebook. He was a genuinely nice guy, but seemed to have trouble with relationships (he had a son from a previous complicated relationship) so I was happy to see he had gotten married and his wife was pregnant with twins.

Fast forward a few months and I read his name in the news regarding his murder, the story is truly tragic.  

He had lost his wife in childbirth, but the twins were fine - he was however unable to care for them in his mental state and her parents cared for the babies. He started drinking heavily and visiting strip clubs.  At some point he met a stripper named Maruschka Robinson who he invited to live in his home. This doesn’t really surprise me in that he was extremely trusting and was probably having difficulty dealing with the situation he was in - and simply being lonely. 

He had been paid out quite a large sum of money from the death of his wife.  Maruschka Robinson knew this and together with her drug dealer boyfriend, JP Milan, they would spike his drink with GHB, draw cash from his account, then delete the text messages that would come through notifying of the transaction. This wasn’t enough for them.  The two killed him (asphyxiation) stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and went to Montecasino. A large casino in Johannesburg. I suspect this was because you are able to use credit cards to draw large sums of cash (more than you would from an ATM).  They then left his body to decompose in the parking lot at Montecasino and it was found a few days later. 

The whole story is simply heartbreaking.  Especially for the twins left without either of their parents, all because of these two disgusting people.

845,A Serial Killer Shot Dead By The Police In Bosnia,"Edin Gacic, murderer of four, has been killed by the police of Sarajevo Canton in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In what probably was the biggest manhunt in history of this country, more then 1200 cops searched for the maniac after he killed Saud Sultanić, a clerk, mutilated his body, and took off.

He evaded the justice from February 4 til today (February 12), when he was found by the members of law enforcement near the town of Kiseljak. He started shooting at them, lightly injuring one of the officers. They returned the fire and killed him.

The area is currently swarmed with cops and the entry is being denied to journalists. Aljoša Čampara, the minister of internal affairs, said he'll give more information to the press soon.

**The Backstory**

He was born in 1976, and his father died when he was seven. When the Bosnian War began in 1992, he, a Muslim, stayed in the Serb capital of Banja Luka and was subjected to severe abuse. He finally fled the city in 1994 and went to Croatia, then returned in September of 1995 and joined the Mujahideen, a group well-known for their brutality (among other things, torturing and beheading about twenty serbian POWs and expelling the Serbian civilians after the fall of Vozuća).

First time he killed was in 1998, three years after the war, when he killed one of his former brothers in arms, Ismet Gunić. In the court, he offered multiple motives, and claimed that the government and secret services were involved. The judge didn't buy his story, and he got 14 years in prison.

His mother, Sifeta, who lived with him during the toughest moments of war, testified against him, and said he shouldn't be released under any conditions. In 2002, he got a temporary release. During the release, he murdered Sifeta. After the act, he remained in her house for another two hours, listening to music and eating candies. Then he tried to escape, but was detained in a train in Montenegro two days after.

This time, he got twenty years . However, he walked free after serving two thirds of the sentence, in July of 2017. The warden of the Bihać State Penitentiary, Edhem Velabdžić, pleaded the government institutions not to let him go, and wrote that ""it's obvious he'll will commit another crime"".

In the meantime, Edin tried to live a normal life. He got a certificate of a personal trainer, for ""years of experience in working with people"". Also, he became a tour guide.

The killings started  again about a week ago.

Saud Sultanić opened his store at 7.30 that morning. Soon, a neighbour of his came. A neighbour he and the rest of the locals feared. He was shot three times, then stabbed and kicked in the head. The motive remains unclear.

After the death of Sultanić, the history of the killer became known and ended up in all the newspapers. It caused a massive hysteria, because people in Bosnia aren't  really used to these kinds of things. The worst thing was the fact that nobody knew where the hell he was.

Then, on the night of February 9, a cop was killed in Tarčin near Sarajevo. His gun and about 30 bullets were missing. A couple of hours before, the police got the information that Gačić was seen close to Ušivak, a place 7 miles away from Tarčin.

People all over the country were frightened. The number of kids coming to school halved in the areas where the last two crimes took place.

Luckily, about two hours ago, they managed to locate him and he was killed after refusing to surrender and attacking the S.W.A.T. team.",1,2,"A Serial Killer Shot Dead By The Police In Bosnia Edin Gacic, murderer of four, has been killed by the police of Sarajevo Canton in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

852,Texas Lavender Doe Identified as 21-year-old Dana Lynn Todd,"So my podcast decided to do an episode on the DNA Doe Project because we love what this organization does. If you haven't heard of the DNA Doe Project and are curious to know you can find out [here](http://dnadoeproject.org/). For those of you who want a TL;DR they are use the technique of genetic genealogy (similar to the method used to ID Joseph James DeAngelo also known as The Golden State Killer). 

I initially learned about the murder of [Marcia L. King](https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156) from reddit a while ago and it lead me to my love of the DNA DP. Now I known they identified Lavender Doe not too long ago, but details were released some time after due to the ongoing investigation and pending trial. 

Her identification is bittersweet news, for she truly died a gruesome death.  

“Lavender Doe” has FINALLY been identified after 12 (almost 13) years since the discovery of her body in Gregg County, Texas thanks to the wonderful volunteers who dedicated time and resources for this woman. Dana Lynn Dodd (21) of Jacksonville, FL, was found deceased on October 26, 2006 after deputies responded to a call in Gregg County. 

She had no formal identification on or near her at her time of death. Joseph Wayne Burnett, 41, is suspected and is now being charged with Dana’s murder as well as the murder of his ex-girlfriend Felisha Pearson! From my understanding, he didn't even know Dana's name. He referred to her as ""maybe Ashley."" Sadly her actual cause of death is unknown but is listed as a homicide. 

I am so happy to hear of the positive identification of this former Jane Doe. Thanks to the DNA Doe Project, Dana’s name has been restored to her! She is no longer a Jane Doe, so at least she gets her name back. It was really exciting to hear. May Dana finally rest in peace.

864,Podcast suggestion where the cops/Prosecutor are good.,"So I love true crime podcasts but have seen a trend developing. I am currently listening to In The Dark and I do enjoy it. However, it certainly is biased against the cops. It talks about how poorly they investigated the case and how they pressured an innocent man, which is all certainly true. Other shows like Making A Murderer and Serial love to take the side of the accused. Are there any podcasts out there that focus on a single case where good detective work and clever prosecution catches a bad guy? I believe we deserve to know about when cops and DAs screw up but I think there has to be some really interesting cases out there where the cops get it right. Look at how they caught Dennis Rader for example. That was very clever police work. Maybe our society is too jaded.

888,Best Friend Betrayed: The Murder of Stephen McAfee,"On March 10, 2016, 19 year old Stephen McAfee waited up until about 2:30 AM for his friend to pick him up. He was waiting for his best friend, Andrew Fiacco, also 19, who was going to sell him some marijuana. Both Stephen and Andrew had Aspergers Syndrome, a form of autism and had been friends since childhood. 

When Stephen didn't come home, his parents knew something was wrong and called the police. The family lived in Macomb Township, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit where things were relatively safe and well-to-do. Stephen hadn't taken his coat, money, or credit cards. He didn't have a car or a driver's license. 

When the news broke that Stephen was missing, Andrew left a comment on a local TV news station's Facebook posts about the story:

*This guy right here was my best friend in the entire world. We had our ups and downs but we grew up together as neighborhood friends. We'd get into an argument during the day and we'd stop playing and go home. An hour later either one of us would knock on each other's door and apologize and make up and hug it out and start playing again. We've had our negatives in our past and it's led us to stop talking to each other and seeing each other. He will always be my best friend to me! Not even my best friend, he is family to me. He's like a brother to me. Praying to the lord that he's safe &amp; returns home soon &lt;3*

Two days later, he posted another comment:

*I wish I knew where he was, I would've told authorities already. He had a problem with checking in with his parents or anyone including me. He was very quiet and kept to himself a lot actually. I'd give him fatherly lectures about how he needs to check in with his parents before he goes somewhere or does something or if he went from one place to the next that he needed to let them know when he was going and when he arrived. Never did he do any of those things though. I miss him so much &lt;/3 Please come home brother! We all miss you very much :,(*

Right after those posts were made, Andrew deleted all of the photos of Stephen from his Facebook account. 

13 months later, in April 2017, Andrew Fiacco's girlfriend, Eevette MacDonald, confided in one of her friends that Andrew confessed to her that he had killed Stephen. He then brought her to the body, which was in a field in rural Bruce Township, Michigan. Fiacco told her that he was a hitman in the Mafia and that he killed Stephen because he had witnessed a crime. He then instructed Eevette to take an axe he'd brought along and chop up his body. She refused, and Andrew did it himself, cutting Stephen in half. 

They then took one half of him back to Andrew's house about six miles away in Ray Township. They mixed up some cement and dumped what was left of him into it. Once the cement dried, they buried the remains in a shallow grave in his backyard. 

Eevette's friend immediately made a beeline to the Macomb County Sheriff's Office to tell them what she'd heard. Shortly thereafter, Andrew Fiacco was arrested at an alcohol rehab center and charged with first degree murder, mutilation of a body, felony firearms, and obstruction of justive. Eevette MacDonald was also charged with accessory after the fact and then offered a plea deal in exchange for her testimony against Andrew. 

The trial began in January of 2019. Fiacco's lawyers conceded the mutilation of a body and obstruction of justice charges right off the bat. Andrew Fiacco claimed that he'd shot Stephen in self-defense. 

Andrew's lawyers claimed that Andrew had picked Stephen up fully intending to sell him pot. Andrew had driven Stephen to a vacant lot at the corner of 34 Mile Road and Van Dyke Avenue to conduct the transaction. When they got there, Stephen attacked Andrew, jumping on him and trying to strangle him and Andrew pulled out a gun. He claimed that Stephen got the gun momentarily, and Andrew took it back and shot Stephen in self-defense. 

As he lay there dying, they contended that Andrew shot Stephen twice more to make sure he wouldn't get back up. This was what Andrew told the police during his interrogation and before he led police to the body.

Prosecutors put the medical examiner on the stand, who testified that Stephen had been shot twice in the head, one shot to the front of his head and the other shot to the back of his head, and then once again in the stomach. 

The trial took an ugly turn when Stephen's mother testified that Stephen told her that Andrew had raped him. That statement resulted in a loud and angry objection from the defense, which the judge sustained as hearsay, telling the jury to ignore the remark. 

In closing arguments, the lawyers bickered back and forth. The defense claimed that Andrew's autism caused him to be hypersensitive to perceived slights and overreact to them. The prosecution contended that Fiacco took McAfee's earbuds, cell phone, and watch as trophies after the fact, proving premeditation. The prosecution pointed to testimony of his friends who said he had punched holes in their walls in anger and that he'd gotten into physical altercations before as a demonstration of his violent tendencies. 

Prosecutor William Cataldo and defense lead counsel David Griem were known for their aggressive and sometimes flamboyant courtroom styles. When Griem was cross-examining a police officer, he remarked that a conviction would mean the cop would have ""a scalp to put on the wall."" The ensuing objection from the prosecution resulted in the two getting into an all-out screaming match that Judge Jennifer Faunce struggled to contain. She scolded him for using that term in front of the jury. 

After plenty of theatrics, the jury got the case. They deliberated for 11 hours over two days. Finally, on the afternoon of February 7, 2019, they came back with a verdict: Guilty of second-degree murder. The jury believed the killing was intentional and not justified, but also not premeditated. 

Andrew Fiacco will be sentenced on March 21, 2019. Second-degree murder in Michigan carries a maximum sentence of 15 years to life or any number of years. His sentencing guidelines call for 23-37 years, and he will also have to serve an additional 2 years on top of that for using a gun in the commission of a crime. Michigan law mandates that a prisoner serve the entire minimum sentence before becoming eligible for parole. 

Stephen's family were shocked and dismayed at the verdict. While they were grateful that Andrew will be spending a long time in prison, they would have much preferred a first-degree murder conviction, which carries an automatic life without parole sentence. It will take them a long time to recover from their son's death and subsequent character assassination in court, but at least they can take solace in the fact that their son did get justice in the end.

It will take them a long time to recover from their son's death and subsequent character assassination in court, but at least they can take solace in the fact that their son did get justice in the end.  https://www.wxyz.com/news/jury-reaches-a-verdict-in-andrew-fiacco-trial-charged-with-murder-of-stephen-mcafee",best friend betrayed stephen mcafee march year old stephen mcafee waited friend pick wa waiting best friend andrew fiacco also wa going sell marijuana stephen andrew aspergers syndrome form autism friend since childhood stephen come home parent knew something wa wrong called police family lived macomb township michigan suburb detroit thing relatively safe well stephen taken coat money credit card car driver license news broke stephen wa missing andrew left comment local tv news station facebook post story guy right wa best friend entire world ups grew together neighborhood friend get argument day stop playing go home hour later either one u would knock door apologize make hug start playing negative past led u stop talking seeing always best friend even best friend family brother praying lord safe return home soon lt two day later posted another comment wish knew wa would told authority already problem checking parent anyone including wa quiet kept lot actually give fatherly lecture need check parent go somewhere doe something went one place next needed let wa going arrived never thing though miss much lt please come home brother miss much right post made andrew deleted photo stephen facebook account month later april andrew fiacco girlfriend eevette macdonald confided one friend andrew confessed killed stephen brought body wa field rural bruce township michigan fiacco told wa hitman mafia killed stephen witnessed instructed eevette take axe brought along chop body refused andrew cutting stephen half took one half back andrew house six mile away ray township mixed cement dumped wa left cement dried buried remains shallow grave backyard eevette friend immediately made beeline macomb county sheriff office tell heard shortly thereafter andrew fiacco wa arrested alcohol rehab center charged first degree mutilation body felony firearm obstruction justive eevette macdonald wa also charged accessory fact offered plea deal exchange testimony andrew trial began january fiacco lawyer conceded mutilation body obstruction justice charge right bat andrew fiacco claimed shot stephen self defense andrew lawyer claimed andrew picked stephen fully intending sell pot andrew driven stephen vacant lot corner mile road van dyke avenue conduct transaction got stephen attacked andrew jumping trying strangle andrew pulled gun claimed stephen got gun momentarily andrew took back shot stephen self defense lay dying contended andrew shot stephen twice make sure get back wa andrew told police interrogation led police body prosecutor put medical examiner stand testified stephen shot twice head one shot front head shot back head stomach trial took ugly turn stephen mother testified stephen told andrew raped statement resulted loud angry objection defense judge sustained hearsay telling jury ignore remark closing argument lawyer bickered back forth defense claimed andrew autism caused hypersensitive perceived slight overreact prosecution contended fiacco took mcafee earbuds cell phone watch trophy fact proving premeditation prosecution pointed testimony friend said punched hole wall anger gotten physical altercation demonstration violent tendency prosecutor william cataldo defense lead counsel david griem known aggressive sometimes flamboyant courtroom style griem wa cross examining police officer remarked conviction would mean cop would scalp put wall ensuing objection prosecution resulted two getting screaming match judge jennifer faunce struggled contain scolded using term front jury plenty theatrics jury got case deliberated hour two day finally afternoon february came back verdict guilty second degree jury believed killing wa intentional justified also premeditated andrew fiacco sentenced march second degree michigan carry maximum sentence year life number year sentencing guideline call year also serve additional year top using gun commission michigan law mandate prisoner serve entire minimum sentence becoming eligible parole stephen family shocked dismayed verdict grateful andrew spending long time prison would much preferred first degree conviction carry automatic life without parole sentence take long time recover son death subsequent character assassination court least take solace fact son get justice end http wxyz news jury reach verdict andrew fiacco trial charged stephen mcafee,best friend betrayed stephen mcafee

891,The murder/suicide of Zach Bowen and Addie Hall (Link to Video Blog covering this at end of article!),"The Murder/Suicide of Zach &amp; Addie: Drugs, Alcohol, and Voodoo

On October 17, 2006 authorities received a call about a man who jumped to his death from the fifth floor of the Omni Royal Hotel in New Orleans, dying immediately. At first, his death seemed to be a “normal” suicide until a five-page long suicide note was found in his front pocket with instructions on how to find the dismembered pieces of his girlfriend.

Friends and family described Zach as an All-American guy with lots of friends and a healthy social life. When he was 18 he married a 27 year old stripper, Lana Shupack. He soon enlisted into the United States Army in order to provide for his wife and their two children; he served two tours, one in Iraq and one in Kusovo. 

According to those closest to him, Zach’s personality began to change while overseas; they blamed it on Zach being homesick. Despite wanting out of military, when he was finally discharged on a general, or ‘Other Than Honorable’ discharge, he was bitter. After he came home, he became a bartender in the French Quarter and separated from his wife. A fellow bartender Addie Hall caught his eye and they soon became romantically involved; their biggest joy in the relationship was drinking together.

When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in August of 2005, Zach and Addie refused to evacuate the apartment they shared together situated above a well known Voodoo shop. While the hurricane devastated their surroundings, they passed the time by drinking; Addie was known to flash her breasts at passing police officers and would provide cocktails to anyone visiting their neighborhood. Addie was also known for her hot temper and would mercilessly beat Zach when she was intoxicated and was known to brandish a weapon at anyone who crossed her. 

On October 5, 2006 Zach strangled Addie inside their apartment on N. Rampart Street. He then proceeded to cut her corpse into pieces and place her head in a pot on the stove. Despite varying accounts on which body parts were put into the oven, he either placed her hands and feet inside another pot or her hands and legs inside the oven. 

His purpose behind cooking her body was to “separate the meat from the bone,” helping with the disposal process. Her body was so charred it took several days for authorities to identify her. He then stayed in the apartment, writing messages on the walls with spray paint and writing his suicide note. On one sprayed message, it said “Please call my wife. I love her. I’m a total failure. Look in the oven. Please help me stop the pain.” He also burnt himself with cigarettes for every year he was alive for every failure he ever committed.

There are a few theories on what may have taken place on October 5, 2006. If you ask the locals of the French Quarter, they will tell you that a demonic entity inhabiting the Voodoo shop below their apartment influenced him to commit such an atrocity. After all, the Voodoo Spiritual Temple is well respected in New Orleans. A more science based theory is that he experienced PTSD or some form of trauma from overseas and that this led to his personality change and alcoholism. He kept stating that he was a failure and mentioned that he loved his wife; did he regret separating from her and snapped after being abused from Addie for so long?

899,Anyone remember dog attack case this case from 2001?,"This case is so sad. In 2001, Diane Whipple of San Francisco is mauled to death by two dogs that belonged to her neighbor. She was coming home with groceries where the dogs belonging to Marorie Knoller &amp; Robert Noel bit Diane 73 times. The attack was clearly unprovoked.

Marjorie Knoller was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In 2004 a judge reduced her sentence to manslaughter and she was released briefly in 2004. Then that reduced sentence was overturned and she was sent back to prison for second degree murder. 

Her husband, who was not in the building at the time of the attack, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. 

 There were numerous witnesses that came forward following Diane Whipple's death who had personally experienced the dogs' aggression. I don't know if I agree with Knoller's murder charge...but I do think that the two convicted were very neglectful of the clear red flags regarding their dogs' behavior. I don't think this woman had intentions of ever killing Diane Whipple. Please note that I truly believe Marjorie and Robert are absolutely guilty of manslaughter from their negligent actions regarding their dogs' escalating violent behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are some reports of sexual abuse of the dogs by the owners which may have contributed to their violent behavior. They also may have been aroused watching their dogs hurt other dogs and people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also note, the dogs were really owned by a convicted white supremacist gang member who was incarcerated at Pelican Bay State Prison. Paul Schneider, a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood, who was adopted by the odd couple. Video I have tagged alleges that the couple wanted a polygamist marriage, but since they could not legally do so, they adopted Schneider as their son...

&amp;#x200B;

Either way the couple never showed any remorse regarding the death of Diane Whipple and tried to distance themselves of any responsibility regarding Diane's death. 

&amp;#x200B;

Were the dogs trained to attack for ""security"" reasons? 

Was Schneider/Knoller/Noel also part of an underground dog fighting club? 

Did anyone ever file complaints before Diane Whipple's death? 

What do you guys think of Knoller's parole being denied?

929,"23 y/o Crystal Brooke Howell of Maggie Valley, North Carolina killed her father on February 24, 2014. She then hid the body, moved her friends in, threw parties & installed a stripper pole in the kitchen.","Crystal Brooke Howell was 17 at the time the murder occurred. Her father, Michael Howell, was a former Columbia County News-Times sports editor. 

District Attorney Jeff Jones states, ""Miss Howell had previously told her friends that her father had killed himself. She then started to drive his car and spend his money. She had her friends move in, had a drug-fueled party and even had a stripper pole installed in the kitchen.""  

On October 8, 2018, Crystal admits that she shot her father in the head while he napped, hiding his body for a month inside a plastic container in the family's storage shed. Prosecutors believe that after the crime she invited friends to move into the home, lying about the cause of her father's death.

Authorities were notified when house guests staying in the family's eight-bedroom cabin made the gruesome discovery of Howell’s body on March 22.  They were moving a pinball machine into the shed when they found the body.

Howell’s ex-wife, Kristina Rester, said Crystal Howell called her March 19 to say her father had released her from his custody and she wanted to move back to Augusta. Rester said she told her daughter she would have to provide proof of emancipation before she would allow it, but Crystal Howell showed up March 22 at Rester’s home anyway. She was driving her father’s orange Land Rover and pulling a U-Haul trailer filled with her belongings.

Crystal was arrested in a local motel. Cops state that she was acting like she didn't know what was going on. She ended up pleading guilty to first-degree murder and concealing a death/failing to report a death not from natural causes. She was sentenced to 60 to 84 months in prison for the second charge, followed by a minimum of 25 additional years for the murder charge to be served before she can apply for a parole hearing.

Crystal Howell’s defense attorney Bridgett Aguirre told the court her client had a mental health history. Prosecutors said the accused planned her crime.

“The evidence in this case is that Miss Howell, who had just been caught shoplifting at Ingles by her father that day, came home and thought about killing her dad while she showered,” Jeff Jones said. “Afterwards, she executed him while he slept on the couch.”

Howell hid the body, dumped the couch and sold the shotgun to a friend's dad for $20 in order to cover her tracks, Jones said, effectively covering up the crime for more than a month.

“It’s shocking that a young woman kills her father,” District Attorney Ashley Welch said. “But the fact that Howell then began to spend her father’s money, use his house and drive his car – all after hiding his body and the evidence of her crime – that’s the motive. She wanted to live on her terms at the expense of Michael Howell’s life. It’s very sad.”

Howell was transferred to the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections to serve her sentence.

It started as a neighbor saying they'd heard it, then I heard other parents at my child's school were joking about it at the pickup area, then another neighbor confirmed something happened but he didn't know the details. Part of the rumor was that someone running for local office witnessed the death, and so they arranged to have news sites remove it from their feeds.

I live in a very small town that doesn't have its own obituaries, and if I perform Google News searches I get some **odd** echoes of important key words on spam websites, but nothing **real**. For instance, I'm finding that if I Google certain keywords like my address + the cause of death, I see dozens of spam websites have my address and half-sentences about death scrambled into them, but no coherent websites. I've seen this in the past, where a news story gets diluted to spam sites and affiliate sites, but I've never seen the main article scrubbed. If I say, change it to my neighbor's address, Google has zero results. Clearly at some point my address was in the news!

Also, at some point during the podcast, I think it was Karen, said something like “feeling like things are never going to get better is just proof that it will.”  Has anyone had experience with this? It would be great to hear some stories about being young and feeling like everything sucks and it’s never going to get better and then  later in life having everything completely change and you can look back and be grateful for what you have now.

166,Support for crime victims,"Hi.

I’m looking for friends who have experienced being a crime victim. Some days, it’s harder than others. 

Yesterday, I learned some facts that have left me a bit despondent. 

1. It takes 5-7 years for crime victims to truly heal. I’m just over two years into my trauma therapy and this just broke me. I don’t know that I can take more years of being this lonely and feeling misunderstood as I live with this PTSD.

2. Many crime victims become revictimized. This has happened to me. 

-The original crime was in Sept 2016, first trial Dec 2016, second (his appeal) trial Feb 2017. 
-my business was burglarized in May 2018.
-finally filed charges in a new incident against a stalker in Sept 2018 (I was in denial that I was being stalked beginning in Dec 2017, because court was sooo traumatic the first time around.).

Anyway, I’m looking for hope. Looking for support. My friends, well, they don’t exactly get it. A few of them live with trauma or PTSD, but not as a result of being a crime victim and/or not having their constitutional rights upheld in court, which is also something I experienced with the first crime. 

How do I stop being victimized? I’m so tired. I feel like there is a target on my back that says, “yo, fuck with this one.” I have words, I’m articulate, I address safety threats immediately. I don’t understand why stupid stuff is still happening. 

And I’m really lonely. 

I’ve perused and comment on things on r/cptsd , r/ptsd and have yet to find a place where crime victims are supported. Figured I would post here since I listen to the podcast and have heard the community is baller. ",0,4,"Support for crime victims Hi.

167,Help me find a case mentioned in a hometown story?,"
Hey everyone, I hope someone can help me remember this case. I am fairly sure (thanks to reddit!) I heard it as a home town story in a minisode of MFM, but I can’t find the case name or find the episode again of the life of me.

Details I am sure of:

A girl went missing as a teenager. Several years later (15 or so) her adult body was found i.e she had been alive, and never found, from the time she was went missing until shortly before the body was found.

Details I am not so sure are correct - could be red herrings:

She was jogging when she went missing, maybe in a park or wooded area, or in her neighbourhood. She might have been on a school sports team.

She disappeared in the 1990s and her body was found in the 2000s.

Her whole body may not have been found - it might have been only a part or otherwise found dismembered.

The body was found on the side of the road / a highway.

There was speculation she had been kept in captivity, as a slave / sex slave, or sold into slavery.

Something about a tattoo or brand.

Something about a piece of furniture being relevant to her body being found.

I hope someone can help with the episode or any details of the case. Thanks!",0,2,"Help me find a case mentioned in a hometown story?  Hey everyone, I hope someone can help me remember this case.

187,My Mom Helped Execute a Serial Killer (Nebraska // Hometown Murder),"Hi everyone!

I had the amazing pleasure of seeing Karen and Georgia during their tour when they came to the Orpheum Theatre here in Omaha, Nebraska! A week or so before the show I had sent in this hometown murder and thought the murderinos here could possibly appreciate it as well! 

I live in Omaha Nebraska and I’m a college student with an internship as an Autopsy Assistant. This position has taught me so much and given me so many amazing stories to share - but that’s for another day. This story is about my Mother. A badass, cancer surviving Sheriff’s Deputy who was a part of the case in finding and executing a world-class-piece-of-shit-serial-killer. 

John Joseph Joubert IV, aka The Nebraska Boy Snatcher was born in Lawrence, MA. In 1982, Joubert took the life of his first victim, 11 year old Richard Stetson. The boy’s body was found undressed, stabbed and strangled. In 1983, Joubert moved to Nebraska where he proceeded to torture, molest and murder two more precious baby angels. 

On December 2, 1983 the body of Christopher Walden was found by my badass mother and the rest of her team in a grassy field in Papillion, NE. His throat was cut so deeply he was almost decapitated. Due to being on scene of the discovery, my Mom and her partner became the individuals who went and told the Walden family that their 12 year old boy had been found. 

In 1984 a preschool teacher called the police saying she saw a young man driving in the area. When the driver saw the teacher writing down his license plate, he stopped and threatened her before fleeing. The license plate was traced and found to be rented by John Joubert, an enlisted radar technician from Offutt Air Force Base. It turned out that his own car was being repaired. A search warrant was issued, and rope consistent with that used to bind the first boy found in NE, Danny Joe Eberle, was found in his barracks room. 

Robert K. Ressler, the FBI's head profiler at the time, had immediate access to the information about the two boys in Nebraska and worked up a description which matched Joubert. While he was presenting the case of the two Nebraska boys to a training class at the FBI academy at Quantico, a police officer from Portland, Maine noted the similarities to a case in his jurisdiction which took place while Joubert lived there prior to joining the Air Force. Bite-mark comparisons proved that Joubert was responsible for the Maine killing in addition to those in Nebraska. Ressler and the Maine investigators came to believe that Joubert joined the military to get away from Maine after the murder of the Stetson boy. 

Joubert then confessed to killing the two boys, and on January 12, 1984, he was charged with their murders. After several psychiatric evaluations it was found he had OCD, sadistic tendencies and suffered from schizoid personality disorder -  He was found to have been not psychotic at the time of the crimes. Joubert was executed by the state of Nebraska, (14 days after I was born) on July 17, 1996 by the electric chair. He was the second person executed in Nebraska since the death penalty was reintroduced in the state in 1973. 

This case has always affected my Mom in many ways since she was so closely attached to it. Growing up, from a young age I was taught to fuck politeness and not talk to strangers or wander too far from the house alone. The field where Christopher Walden was found was on the way to my dance studio when I was little and the only constructive criticism I give my mother would be to not tell your 7 year old daughter that “that’s where we found the body!” On her way to ballet. One of my Mom’s classic phrases of my childhood was “I’m so glad we got that fucker to fry.” 

If you made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read this novel and hearing a little bit about my Mom’s badass career.

Stay sexy &amp; avoid telling your 7 year old daughter about serial killers on the way to ballet!

After several psychiatric evaluations it was found he had OCD, sadistic tendencies and suffered from schizoid personality disorder -  He was found to have been not psychotic at the time of the crimes. Joubert was executed by the state of Nebraska, (14 days after I was born) on July 17, 1996 by the electric chair. He was the second person executed in Nebraska since the death penalty was reintroduced in the state in 1973.   This case has always affected my Mom in many ways since she was so closely attached to it. Growing up, from a young age I was taught to fuck politeness and not talk to strangers or wander too far from the house alone. The field where Christopher Walden was found was on the way to my dance studio when I was little and the only constructive criticism I give my mother would be to not tell your 7 year old daughter that “that’s where we found the body!” On her way to ballet. One of my Mom’s classic phrases of my childhood was “I’m so glad we got that fucker to fry.”   If you made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read this novel and hearing a little bit about my Mom’s badass career.  Stay sexy & avoid telling your 7 year old daughter about serial killers on the way to ballet!   **If you’d like to learn more details about Joubert, I’ve attached a link to the Wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joubert_(serial_killer)",mom helped execute serial killer nebraska hometown hi everyone amazing pleasure seeing karen georgia tour came orpheum theatre omaha nebraska week show sent hometown thought murderinos could possibly appreciate well live omaha nebraska college student internship autopsy assistant position ha taught much given many amazing story share another day story mother badass cancer surviving sheriff deputy wa part case finding executing world class piece shit serial killer john joseph joubert iv aka nebraska boy snatcher wa born lawrence joubert took life first victim year old richard stetson boy body wa found undressed stabbed strangled joubert moved nebraska proceeded torture molest two precious baby angel december body christopher walden wa found badass mother rest team grassy field papillion ne throat wa cut deeply wa almost decapitated due scene discovery mom partner became individual went told walden family year old boy found preschool teacher called police saying saw young man driving area driver saw teacher writing license plate stopped threatened fleeing license plate wa traced found rented john joubert enlisted radar technician offutt air force base turned car wa repaired search warrant wa issued rope consistent used bind first boy found ne danny joe eberle wa found barrack room robert k ressler fbi head profiler time immediate access information two boy nebraska worked description matched joubert wa presenting case two nebraska boy training class fbi academy quantico police officer portland maine noted similarity case jurisdiction took place joubert lived prior joining air force bite mark comparison proved joubert wa responsible maine killing addition nebraska ressler maine investigator came believe joubert joined military get away maine stetson boy joubert confessed killing two boy january wa charged several psychiatric evaluation wa found ocd sadistic tendency suffered schizoid personality disorder wa found psychotic time joubert wa executed state nebraska day wa born july electric chair wa second person executed nebraska since death penalty wa reintroduced state case ha always affected mom many way since wa closely attached growing young age wa taught fuck politeness talk stranger wander far house alone field christopher walden wa found wa way dance studio wa little constructive criticism give mother would tell year old daughter found body way ballet one mom classic phrase childhood wa glad got fucker fry made far thank much taking time read novel hearing little bit mom badass career stay sexy avoid telling year old daughter serial killer way ballet learn detail joubert attached link wikipedia page http en wikipedia org wiki john joubert serial killer,mom helped execute serial killer nebraska hometown

while I was hanging out after school with my friends, we were still near school (a place we always hang out). a girl (classmate) came to me and said ''your brother told me to tell you that he is waiting behind the school for you''. I swear I was about to get up when I realized that my brother can easily call me on the phone? I called my brother, he wasn't answering (he was at work). we asked the girl how the guy she saw looks like. She told me and everything she said was how my brother typically looks like. She also said that he was in his car. She said that she was leaving school and he called her. At that time I thought, maybe its him.

My friends told me to go with all of us (we were 3+ that girl) it was weird situation, maybe it was my brother, it was just weird situation. I decided to go with them to see who that person was but there was no car anymore? I kept on calling my brother. Finally, my brother answered and he said that he never came to my school today.

The girl was so sure that there was a guy searching for me because he gave her my name, class and he even mentioned the colour of my hair. The most suspicious is that the girl was my classmate too, I mean how did he pick my classmate ? how did he know she knows me and knows where I hang out? Also I am even suspicious of the girl, I mean why help him? but maybe because I am her classmate she helped him? I am confused.

I called my father to pick me up.

**Today:**

There was truly someone that pretended to be my brother. Me and my father went to the principle today and we even checked the school camera footage. There was a car, we couldnt see his face and the plate number but everything my classmate said was true, there was really someone that lied about being my brother. We went to the police, we told them everything, my classmate told them how the guy looked like. The police said they will make sure to drive by our house and school everyday (guarding).

Murderer: * does the clique thing of jumping out of a bush* I'm gonna kill you (because we all know they come right out and say it)

Me: *flashes my SSDGM keychain at them*

Murderer: *covers eyes and crouches* Oh God. Not Karen and Georgia. I must flee. *murderer flees*

Karen and Georgia did it again.

*cue hero music*

316,TRUE CRIME FEST FT. Billy Jensen and Paul Holes,"I hope this post is allowed!! I know it isn't explicitly MFM but it's Billy Jensen &amp; Paul Holes content!

&amp;#x200B;

I know the audience was packed with Murderinos last night at Gramercy Theater in NYC for True Crime Fest!! For anyone who wasn't able to make it or didn't know about it, Billy Jensen gave a little talk last night on his new book *Chase Darkness with Me*, and was interviewed by none other than Paul Holes himself! He gave a few shout outs to the murderinos in the crowd (in which almost the entire room erupted in yelling &amp; clapping because, duh) and I saw so many of my fellow NY bbs decked out with their best MFM gear! The show was amazing, I can't wait for the book annnd the podcast (s/o to the person in the audience who yelled out ""THATS EXACTLY RIGHT!""), and Billy even had a small meet &amp; greet at the end. Of course I lined up and we all got Citizen Detective diplomas and a few of us came prepared with our copies of *I'll be Gone in the Dark*. It was basically staged like a graduation ceremony where you got your diploma, walked across the stage, shook Billy's hand, and your photo was taken. And just like I did with my own graduation, due to my severe stage fright and social anxiety I completely blacked out the second I started walking across that stage to take photos with him + have him sign my book BUT he did see my ""MURDERINO"" shirt and signed my book the best way possible and I wanted to share it with you all!!! I also attached photos of the cute af diplomas they gave away, too.

&amp;#x200B;

For everyone wondering, he is as nice and sincere as I had hoped and dreamed he would be. He even mingled at the bar for a little bit after and let me pull him aside to tell him about my own Hometown Murder that he wrote down in his phone to look into. So nice, so sweet, so dark, so tallll!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Who else was there? Where my fellow NYC Murderinos attt?? Is anyone going to the Paul Holes meet and greet tonight? If so–PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW IT GOES. Thanks!!

No one gets charged

I have no idea how to get this idea off the ground.
Any suggestions?

I should add that I’m a middle class schmuck.....so a first class trip to a MFM show in Napa Valley probably can’t happen. But maybe an overnight road trip, on the East coast, would be doable. Hard goods and merchandise is certainly on the table too.

She’s a huge fan of the podcast....wears SSDGM t shirts,  stickers on the car, etc.  She really enjoys learning about the crimes, and all that.   I have no idea how to get this idea off the ground. Any suggestions?  I should add that I’m a middle class schmuck.....so a first class trip to a MFM show in Napa Valley probably can’t happen. But maybe an overnight road trip, on the East coast, would be doable. Hard goods and merchandise is certainly on the table too.   Signed,  Clueless husband who REALLY wants to impress the awesome wife that he doesn’t deserve. :) ",wife huge fan need gift anniversary theme idea wife turned year much birthday february suck since dropped ball birthday trying redeem making whole goddam year year infuse upcoming anniversary may favorite murderer theme something huge fan podcast wear ssdgm shirt sticker car etc really enjoys learning idea get idea ground suggestion add middle class schmuck first class trip mfm show napa valley probably happen maybe overnight road trip east coast would doable hard good merchandise certainly table signed clueless husband really want impress awesome wife deserve,wife huge fan need gift anniversary theme idea

386,What should I do??,"So this weekend I watched my besties dogs, when mine and hers get together they get noisy, loud even, especially with the neighbors dogs next door. This morning I woke up and took my dogs out, there was a hunting arrow stuck in the ground, it was lodged pretty deep, so I have to assume someone shot it. It scares me bc the dogs could’ve been out and hit with it. I got angry, broke it and in my pettiness stuck the two broken ends in my front yard. 

Tonight I took the dogs out and the boys were fixated on something in the yard. It was a piece of pizza, like full piece besides what they had already eaten before I got out to them. Now I’m worried someone poisoned my pups.

What do I do? Should I call the non emergency line? Should I make a report of this? I’m so frustrated because it doesn’t seem like much, but is definitely something deliberate. This for sure isn’t helping my anxiety.

Note: I have had one issue with neighbors caddy corner from me in the back. The neighbors were in their backyard carrying on being loud and when my dogs went outside, my dogs were barking at them. This was mid day. But I overheard them saying “looks like I’m gonna have to grill up some dog tonight” and other weird ass shit. I didn’t report it or anything just figuring it was drunk shenanigans but it def rubbed me the wrong way.

I had a question regarding reselling tickets. I have two tickets for the Milwaukee show on May 16th. I'm currently not certain if I'll be able to make it due to that being in the middle of graduation season for many friends.


I checked my etix email and it says I'm not able to view my tickets until May 4th. It also, obviously, states that they can't be resold for reasons X, Y, and Z.

But I know people have sold theirs off. I've never had to, but if it comes down to it, how do I sell mine?

Is stubhub the best option? Or should I move them to will call? I live in Chicago so I wouldn't even mind meeting someone halfway from Milwaukee to exchange a printed copy.

&amp;#x200B;

So my gf works at a BBB and tonight an older man(70's) approached her. He said to her ""Do you know this girl?"" while he is pulling out a photo from his wallet. The photo was of her with her named typed on it. She said her face went pale and was immediately uncomfortable and creeped out. She can't recall how she responded. He slid the photo back into his wallet and proceeded to pull out a business card saying that ""if you need help with things around the house, I help out some women around my neighborhood"". Just super weird. She took the card and he walked off. Never bought any item in the store just intentionally seemed to seek her out. She called the police to file a report and told her managers of duty of what happened. The managers didn't seem concerned. Meanwhile, she is still really traumatized and doesn't know what to do or think.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think of all this? PS- She remembers him from about a month or two ago. He was asking about this strange tiny camera that he had on him and if bed bath had any parts for it. Which is bullshit bc they don't sell anything like that. Little did she know that he snuck a picture of her in that moment and this is the exact photo he showed her today.

447,"Jazz It! 100 yr anniversary of the Axeman, Tuesday","Just saw the Buzzfeed Unsolved episode for the Axeman of New Orleans on YouTube and realized the night proposed in the letter is exactly 100 years, even matching the day of the week, this next Tuesday, March 19, 2019. So don't forget to 'Jazz It' at 12:15 (earthly time) next Tuesday night!

The letter was published March 13, so I'm not able to give quite as much warning, but to refresh your memory:

Hell, March 13, 1919

Esteemed Mortal of New Orleans:The Axeman


They have never caught me and they never will. They have never seen me, for I am invisible, even as the ether that surrounds your earth. I am not a human being, but a spirit and a demon from the hottest hell. I am what you Orleanians and your foolish police call the Axeman.

When I see fit, I shall come and claim other victims. I alone know whom they shall be. I shall leave no clue except my bloody axe, besmeared with blood and brains of he whom I have sent below to keep me company.

If you wish you may tell the police to be careful not to rile me. Of course, I am a reasonable spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.

Undoubtedly, you Orleanians think of me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but I could be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay thousands of your best citizens (and the worst), for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.

Now, to be exact, at 12:15 (earthly time) on next Tuesday night, I am going to pass over New Orleans. In my infinite mercy, I am going to make a little proposition to you people. Here it is:

I am very fond of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band is in full swing at the time I have just mentioned. If everyone has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.

Well, as I am cold and crave the warmth of my native Tartarus, and it is about time I leave your earthly home, I will cease my discourse. Hoping that thou wilt publish this, that it may go well with thee, I have been, am and will be the worst spirit that ever existed either in fact or realm of fancy.

“When you start telling yourself stuff because you are in trauma, you’re in a bad place, when you’re like “everybody thinks I’m a piece of shit,” if you’re hearing messages like that from within your own head, you have to pause it and you have to step out and go “that could also not be true at all; everyone could love me.” Because when you get into that mindset, you start making bad decisions for yourself as punishment, and you don’t deserve that punishment.” a

Story time!

This happened on the way to work. I'm carpooling and just as we turn a corner I see what looks like a mannequin laying in the front yard of the corner house like a dead body.  Its super white like almost unnaturally white.  Our windows are down for this.  I laugh and say ""Well that is nice"" thinking someone just tossed a mannequin out on the front lawn not thinking it looks like a corpse.  It is then I realize its just a young woman sunbathing in a VERY skimpy bikini.  So I felt like a perv

I'm sure I didn't exactly split the atom with this one, but it made me smile. I wanted to share it with someone and, in the absence of walky-talky friends, I submit it to the murderinos.

I got sober a few years ago, then botched a suicide attempt a year later, and the one thing that has kept me going more than anything else is a childlike sense of wonder. The future can be terrifying, and the past may be monstrous, so I stay dialed in with what's going on around me and let a little bit of light shine through. Make eye contact with a squirrel, talk back to birds, laugh at any of the thousands of small mistakes I make navigating through my day. Being my own worst critic, I try to give myself the same latitude that I'd give to anyone else just once a day. 

It's only by doing myself small kindness that I've been able to keep my head above water. It took me three days to be ok with sharing this, but I kept at it because I know that for every thousand people that scroll past this or scoff at sincerity, there might be one person who's hanging on by a thread that this will get through to.

I work for my state’s fish and wildlife department and I see so much trash in all our local wildlife areas it has alway made me so sad. My coworkers and I try to clean up what we can while we are out there but it never seems like enough. My coworkers and I are so excited to see people actively trying to clean up trash. I was trying to see if there is a local cleanup group in my area when I though I wonder if there is an MFM subgroup for that?!?  Has anyone heard of one? Or have any good name ideas for me if I were to start one? I figure we could all post pictures of our cleanup efforts and share any zerowaste tips!,trashtag cleanup group new cleanup challenge ha trending weekend ha excited work state fish wildlife department see much trash local wildlife area ha alway made sad coworkers try clean never seems enough coworkers excited see people actively trying clean trash wa trying see local cleanup group area though wonder mfm subgroup ha anyone heard one good name idea start one figure could post picture cleanup effort share zerowaste tip,trashtag cleanup group

518,How Some Girl Puking Led Us to Meeting Georgia!,"Last night a group of my friends and I went to the Las Vegas MFM show at the park theater! (Shout out if you were there!) The show was obviously amazing, but what happened the rest of the night can only be described as fate. 
We were sitting up in the balcony section 405 and the girls behind us were talking loudly so I politely turned around and asked them to please keep it down. After a while, and a little bit more noise from the girls, we hear the girl say ""I think I just got thrown up on!"" We turn around and sure enough, some other chick threw right up on the girls directly behind us. Ew. 
We thought it was super gross but whatever, we weren't going to let it ruin our time. So during the end when they brought out Rosa from Brooklyn nine-nine, the girl who was thrown up on came back and she was bawling her eyes out apologizing for everything that happened. We told her we were sorry for what happened to her and just struck up a conversation. We ended up chatting in the theater until we were asked to leave. At that point we had collected a few of other new friends and decided to go grab food at Nacho Daddy (cause Georgia was talking about Nachos) 
We hung out for quite some time and had a blast then walked back to the theater to go our separate ways. We were just about to push the 'request' button on Lyft, when my sister said she had to use the restroom. So we walked in to take a quick trip to the ladies room all the while talking about how our night exceed expectations. As we were checking out our hair and makeup the beautiful Georgia Hardstark herself came up to wash her hands in the sink right next to us! We kept our cool and said thank you for the show, briefly told her out story, and gave her a giant hug! It was amazing! 
We are so grateful that we had the chance to experience this huge gathering of Murderinos, and getting to hug and thank Georgia face to face was just a beyond incredible way to top it off.

581,My friend’s experience with the Dexter Copycat Killer from the most recent episode.,"Hey everyone! This is a quick story that I have always wanted to send in a hometown but never have since it’s not technically my own. Since the case was just covered by Georgia I figured I would share it here!

I grew up in Edmonton, Alberta and lived there until I moved after high school. I’m in the arts and one of my friends who is also in the arts once told me that she was cast in a small local movie that has never been released due to it being used as evidence in a murder case. Obviously I had to hear more about it and eventually found out that she had been cast, and shot scenes as, the main character’s daughter in the “copycat” film (House of Cards) that Mark Twitchell had made which depicted the crime he eventually committed. This was when she was about 8 or 9 and she was just CASUALLY being directed by a future killer. You can briefly see her in some of the shots of the film that were used by news stations in our city - she said he seemed really normal from what she could remember of the experience.

595,Current events hometown murder!!!,"Happening right now in the Boston/Providence area...I'll leave a link below but basically this guy Louis Coleman was outside a nightclub in Boston and met this girl Jassy Correia and she got into his car willingly around 2am. Two hours later he got to his apartment in Providence (it should be about a 1 hour drive) and carried her limp body into his buliding and once inside, dragged her into his apartment. There is later footage of him buying things like surgical gloves, scented candles, duct tape, Tyvex suits, goggles, CLN release bleach bath at Walmart, and a large suitcase. They pulled him over later in Delaware and her naked, bruised body was found stuffed inside a couch cushion cover in a garbage bag in the suitcase in his trunk, covered in baking soda (to absorb the smell). Also in his car were things like garbage bags, charcoal air purifies, air fresheners, safety glasses, pliers, disinfectant, a butane lighter, and long-handled pruners. 

&amp;#x200B;

When they were looking for him there were a bunch of helicopters downtown in Providence which was crazy to see. Also, he played in a volleyball league with a bunch of people I know who were all really surprised to find out he was the culprit- they all said he was really nice and normal-seeming.

627,The Curious Case of the Missing Subtenant,"***UPDATE***

They FINALLY found her - she’s ok, she was fucking MIA bc she realized she didn’t have enough money for rent and couldn’t pay. Apparently she assured the ex she would handle rent money this month, but overspent by a long shot and then became unreachable instead of letting anybody know what was going on. Oy. 

I finally got all of my rent money yesterday. The ex bf has to get a loan from his work and she had to get a loan somehow too. Hopefully this is the last I have to deal with them until the lease ends in August...

*Original post*

Currently dealing with this and can’t help but think the murderinos would be interested in joining me on this wild ride. 

So back in August I got a great new job in an awesome new city about 4.5 hours away from the crappy city I was living in. The problem is, I had already resigned my lease for my apartment, and couldn’t get out of it so the leasing company suggest I sublease. Since it’s a college town, it wasn’t too hard to find some subtenants - a bf and a gf moving in together. I had them sign a contract essentially saying that they agree to the terms of the master lease and if they fail to abide by those terms and end up getting evicted, they are still legally obligated to pay for rent throughout the rest of the term of the master lease (ends this August).

Fast forward to today. They haven’t been great subtenants, but I usually don’t have to deal with them too much. Until now when I find out they haven’t paid rent for March yet. I also found out that they broke up and she’s not living there anymore, yet she supposedly has the rent money for March according to him. However her phone supposedly broke, so I couldn’t get a hold of her and the bf told me he can’t get a hold of her either and hasn’t seen her in days. 

It’s been a few days of trying to reach her, so finally I fb stalked and reached out to her sister, to see if she had a suggestion for how to get in touch. Her sister said “that’s weird because I haven’t heard from her in awhile either” so she called their mom. Their mom also hasn’t heard anything from her even though the parents live right outside the city, and I was under the impression the girl was living with her parents until her new lease starts in May. So the sister responded to me saying the mom is worried and was going to call the girl’s work, and that she would get back to me as soon as the mom called her back. This was at 10 AM this morning, and I still haven’t heard anything. 

So, not only am I out of March rent and waiting to figure out wtf to do, I also am worried about this girl’s whereabouts bc apparently v few people have heard from her in the last couple of days...",0,13,"The Curious Case of the Missing Subtenant ***UPDATE***  They FINALLY found her - she’s ok, she was fucking MIA bc she realized she didn’t have enough money for rent and couldn’t pay. Apparently she assured the ex she would handle rent money this month, but overspent by a long shot and then became unreachable instead of letting anybody know what was going on. Oy.   I finally got all of my rent money yesterday. The ex bf has to get a loan from his work and she had to get a loan somehow too. Hopefully this is the last I have to deal with them until the lease ends in August...  *Original post*  Currently dealing with this and can’t help but think the murderinos would be interested in joining me on this wild ride.   So back in August I got a great new job in an awesome new city about 4.5 hours away from the crappy city I was living in. The problem is, I had already resigned my lease for my apartment, and couldn’t get out of it so the leasing company suggest I sublease. Since it’s a college town, it wasn’t too hard to find some subtenants - a bf and a gf moving in together. I had them sign a contract essentially saying that they agree to the terms of the master lease and if they fail to abide by those terms and end up getting evicted, they are still legally obligated to pay for rent throughout the rest of the term of the master lease (ends this August).

669,Need help: how to get rid of murder stool,"Okay, I'll get right into this:

&amp;#x200B;

My ex-boyfriend violently murdered a woman last year (not ready to talk about it\*).  
He lived with me for a short time, and although I never keep anything from exes,  I forgot that this stool I'd been using was something he'd built.  
His signature is on the bottom.

I grew up agnostic, I don't believe in cursed objects.  
However, this stool, aka the ""bad vibes bench"" has had some weird shit going on, and I need to get rid of it.
**(EDIT: of the weird shit that happened, I climbed on my kitchen table and tried to throw it to the ground to smash it and it landed at a bizarre angle on a *pillow* …it wasn’t a passive drop; if it had landed on a bean bag, it still would not have frozen on contact like that. This was the point where I set it outside)**


&amp;#x200B;

I can't just give it away to another person if it *is* cursed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked a catholic friend who recommended the priest + holy water routine, but I'm afraid to call a priest because 1. It feels silly and 2. I'm afraid they'll think it's a prank, and I don't want to be disrespectful.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked an acquaintance if they have a fire pit I could burn it in, they said yes, but that plan keeps falling through.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone else said ""if he signed it, there's people on ebay that would definitely buy it"" but then I feel kind of weird morally, collecting profit related to the death of someone's loved one, y'know? 

&amp;#x200B;

It needs to GO, but I don't feel comfortable just unceremoniously ditching it by a dumpster. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO,

**What do I do with this?**

——————

**ADDENDUM**

This sub is *My Favorite Murder*, I’m not just going to casually drop the “I-dated-and-lived-with-a-murderer” and follow it up with “ps never acknowledge this; I refuse to talk about it, *how dare you*”

678,An uncomfortable interaction,"I wanted to post this here because I feel like you guys would understand/relate the most to how I’m feeling. First time poster, long time lurker, and if formatting comes off weird sorry I’m on mobile. Some backstory, I’m a gay, mid 20’s female who lives in what would be considered the country in a big farmhouse with elderly parents in the Midwest. 

Last night I had a guy friend stop by so I could get him the money that I had owed him for some items he had picked up for me. Now this guy is a coworker of my aunts so I trust him enough to be alone around him and whatnot, he’s a mid 20’s male himself. He texts he’s on his way and says ‘I’ll be there in 15 sexy”. Should have been my first red flag but I’m stupid. He pulls into my driveway and I go outside and get in his car because it’s freezing out and I don’t like people in the house, and he’s on the phone with one of his friends when he tells them “I gotta go I got a thick ass girl in my car” red flag #2. I’m already starting to panic etc., when I hand him the money and he asks if I missed him. I kinda laugh and tell him “you know I’m gay right” and, of course, I get the ‘so what’. He puts his hand on my thigh and starts talking about how ‘thick’ I am/ if I ever want a man to ‘rub me down’ to call him. And at this point I’m in 100% panic mode and just want out of the car. I give him the money, get the stuff he had for me and get out when he tells me to call him if I get lonely. I just feel so creeped out and disgusted by this guy because he’s a good friend of my aunts and has always been civil to me before this, plus he knows where I live is secluded from civilization, and I essentially live alone. 

I just wanted to vent to somebody about it and I knew all of you would understand. I ordered a thing of pepper spray last night right after this happened but I’m so freaked out I’m considering maybe a small rifle or shotgun for home protection. I hate that I don’t even feel safe in my own home right now. And I hate that I put myself in this position by letting him come to my house.

682,Trying to remember which episode.....,"Had a woman who went on dates with sex offenders to get their DNA.....her husband was identified incorrectly by a surviving child victim as the killer. 

As I remember it a grandmother and grand daughter were alone in a rural house the grandmother was assaulted and killed. And I forget if the child was attacked and left for dead or just hid but the next morning the girl went next door for help, was left on the porch for 45 minutes before being taken to the police to report the crime.  The girl said the attacker looked like her unkle, he was picked up and arrested. 

The wife believed her husband and not her niece and decided to take on her own investigation since the police had a witness and conviction. 

She went on the sex registry and found sex offenders in the area, went on dates with them to get their dna from beer bottles etc. froze them and had them tested.....didn’t find anything UNTIL....she worked out that a common law husband of that neighbor the kid ran to, was a sex offender and had just been released just before the crime was committed! And he was currently in prison with her husband! She got her husband to get some DNA from the inmate, smuggled it out of prison and had it tested.....it was a match! 

Does any of this ring a bell? Have I combined multiple stories?

Episode description from the podcast's website: Work hard on something you love for long enough and two things are bound to happen: you master it, and you stop caring about anything not directly related to how much you love that thing. If nothing else, that may be the most important lesson Karen Kilgariff has to offer. Starting out as a stand up in the early 1990's, she went on to become the head writer of *The Rosie Show*, *The Ellen Degeneres Show*, and *The Pete Holmes Show*. After battling addiction, anxiety, and insecurity, Karen has reached a point in her career where she is able to look beyond the stress and struggles of trying to make it, leaving her with zero fucks left to give and one of the most successful podcasts in existence, *My Favorite Murder.* That mindset makes Karen the best possible person to unpack the uncompromising political statements and savage criticisms of modern romance that make up Gang of Four’s influential 1979 release *Entertainment!*

708,Fascinating interrogation analysis videos,"I'm obsessed with this channel Jim Can't Swim, which does breakdowns of interrogations - he has an ongoing series on the very recent Chris Watts case: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfg861hO-Ag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfg861hO-Ag) 

It's like an extension of Georgia's fascination with listening to 911 calls to see if you can guess if they're guilty. I never realised the subtlety and skill in police interrogation tactics - AND the way suspects think they can outsmart them, even subsconsciously.

I'm watching the Jodi Arias (boo) interrogation video right now which you can get if you contribute to his Patreon and for one dollar it is so worth it (I promise this isn't an ad!). It's so creepy seeing her feign emotion when she thinks the interrogator is outside and then go back to normal when he doesn't appear. This also happens in Chris Watts' mistress' video and it's kind of sickening (even though I don't think she was involved in the murder): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AWmgbaf97I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AWmgbaf97I)

712,movies/ tv shows ?,"Hi ! So I know there's a ton of amazing recommendations for all crime related things both from Karen &amp; Georgia and also us murderinos.

Or when you're going through a (more) depressive period and just need to forget about everything ugly in this world...

I think it'd be nice to share some of our favourite non-murder things to watch or listen to and maybe we can discover something new by that? Idk I hope it's not a lame idea. 

My all time favourites for when my depression and anxiety get really bad are pretty much all of  Studio Ghibli , Tim Burton, Quentin Tarantino movies, the office and anything with Audrey Hepburn or Tina fey in it. And some of the older Disney movies like Anastasia. 

So how about you? I desperately need something to take my mind off of ... well , everything lol.

737,meet and greet report and regrets.,"Thought to create a meet and greet report for others like me who are curious and it’s their first time.

**Process:** was pretty easy- we moved to another area of the theatre and waited in line. I was just past halfway and including the M&amp;G was out in an hour. As we got to the main door, a security guy took our merch/ jackets/bags and put them on a table near the door so we would be unencumbered during the photo. Vince takes all the photos, and as mentioned by other murderinos, he's very thorough, snapping pics from the second you see the ladies to your posed photo at the end. This is really a wonderful bonus.

**Karen and Georgia:** ARE SO NICE. They hug you immediately. Ask your name if you're too dazed like me and forget to introduce yourself. Listen to you and respond. Say cute things. Are the best.

**What I wanted to tell them:** I'm like every murderino and have loved true crime forever so thank you for this podcast and the community. You are both so great with your dynamic and your openness about your struggles. You seriously make me laugh every day. When in anxious moods, I often put on your podcast to melt it away. I feel like I've found two friends I have never actually met, and it's been amazing. THANK YOU. ps I live for Elvis' meow at the end of each show.

**Things that came out of my mouth instead:** ""HEY! I'm Armenian so loved the Zankou chicken story."" Karen said things here I don't remember. ""I don't have a gift for you so here's a photo of my pets! That's my dog and I listen to your show every day when I walk her."" Georgia points to my cat and maybe says something. I reply: ""yeah, that's my cat!"" (wtf.) ""Thanks for being my friend during those walks!"" Karen says something like ""thanks for being our friend,"" but again: I don't fucking remember. Then pose time and Vince is busy and I jokingly yell out ""we're waiting Vince!"" (Cringing at that today even though Georgia laughed.) Then I just smile and say ""bye"" and Georgia tells me to say hi to the pets for them. 

**My advice:** know what the hell you want to say in advance if there's something important you want to convey. I've done M&amp;G's before where I prepared in advance, but was too casual about this one. Found myself so suddenly nervous and them so friendly, but felt like I couldn't take too long and that it was all on fast forward.

That all being said, this was definitely a case of meeting one's heroes who turn out to be as marvellous as you imagined. So enjoy your time with them!    ",0,19,"meet and greet report and regrets.

Long story short: She went to Fox Theater in Detroit Friday night for the Live show. After the show, she bought a tote bag that said ""Let me Tell You about My Hometown My Favorite Murder"" on it. We went walking downtown and she suddenly realized that she no longer had the tote bag. We retraced our steps, but could not find the bag.

I looked on the merch website and did not see the tote bag. Is there a way I can buy a new one? I don't care about shipping costs.

777,Researching: Cases Where Family Played Key Role???,"Hey!

I am doing a report for school on specific types of cases. I am looking for cases that were solved because of the determination of someone connected to the case to find justice.

For example, the case of the murder of Judith Johnson. Clarence Elkins was identified as the murderer by his 5-year-old niece (who witnessed the murder) and was convicted. Eight years later, all thanks to the tireless work of his wife Molly, his innocence was proven and someone else was convicted of the murder. Molly KNEW he was innocent and wouldn't stop her quest for justice, even when Police had given up.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence\_Elkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Elkins)

Another example is the murder of Uta Von Schwedler. She was found dead in her bathtub, in what appeared to be a suicide. She left quite a sizeable inheritance to her son. Her son found the circumstances of his mother's death suspicious and poured money towards further investigation, and eventually hired the legal team that made sure his murdering father ended up in jail.

Doesn't necessarily need to be a wrongful conviction, but cases where the persistence and determination of someone connected to the case lead to it being solved - even if it takes years!

Can anyone think of any other cases like this? Even cases where the family played a large role in the initial investigation would work.",0,2,"Researching: Cases Where Family Played Key Role??? Hey!

794,Can you reccomend a really representative episode?,"Hi Murderinos,

I'm recently getting into true crime, and it turns out I'm a huge fan. In my search for new podcasts, I've heard a lot of good things about MFM. However, I bounced off the first couple of episodes.

I don't know if it's a ""this podcast isn't for me"" thing or a ""this podcast hasn't hit it's stride"" thing or a ""I was expecting something else, but I'll like it when I'm expecting what it is"" thing. 

I did find the banter kind of off-putting, but I usually like banter in my podcasts - I think it was that I was expecting more introduction and instead got dropped into the middle of an ongoing conversation.

I'm hoping you lovely folks and recommend a good episode or two that highlight the best things about the podcast, the things you keep coming back for. I figure something that has this much of a fan base is worth trying to get into, but I don't want to power through 10 or 20 or 100 episodes only to discover that it's not for me, and never will be.

828,"Y’all, have any of you watched the doc “Without Charity”?? I NEED YOUR THOUGHTS.","I just finished it, and I don’t even know what to think. I threw it on because it occurred in my home state, and I’d never heard about it. Without giving anything away, three construction workers were executed while on a job site that was the target of a burglary. The question, then became, what role did this 18 yo girl, Charity Payne, play in it. It turned out to be way more conflicting than I expected, and I might even say more heartbreaking. 

I didn’t get an Amanda Knoxian vibe, but I’m still not sure what I think of her innocence. (And so I call on my brilliant murderinos!)

If you haven’t seen it, I would 10/10 recommend! You get a lot of different perspectives from people directly/indirectly impacted by the crime, and I thought it did a nice job of making sure to keep the focus centered around the victims. (I did notice it focused on one victim/family the most, but I’m assuming that was due in part to reasons of the other victims’ families.) It also makes you think about all the moral conundrums of crime and punishment and society.

830,Question for murderinos with young kids,"If I’m posting this in the wrong sub let me know. I don’t really post much. But I figured murderinos would be a good place to ask advice. 

So, I have three boys and then my youngest child is a girl. I have always tried to impress upon my boys that if another person tells you they want you out of their space to respect that, and really they’ve gotten better about that as my daughter has gotten older. So recently my daughter started daycare for the first time (she’s five) and I wanted to make sure that she was confident in telling people “no” in a situation that makes her uncomfortable. (She does that with her brothers all the time, but brothers don’t count.) so we went through various scenarios where things were or were not okay. The conversation led to me making sure that she knows she can always tell me if someone is pressuring her, or touching her when she doesn’t want it (even though I know 5 year olds are super picky about everything, like tickling, or even the whole ‘I’m not touching you’) and she asked if it was okay to tell me if they said not to. I told her “absolutely. You can tell me anything no matter what anyone says to you.” So my question, being raised in a house where “being nice and polite” is what’s MOST important, am I setting her up for success like I’m trying to or pushing it too hard? I honestly don’t know. 
Also any advice for any future questions would be very much appreciated.

840,Buy VIP tix or wait until closer to the show?,"Hello!

I'd REALLY like to go to the show next month. However, I didn't get tickets when they were $40-60 and now they're sold out. :( Stupid, I know but I wanted to take my roommate with me and there weren't seats next to each other and I've never gone to a concert or anything like this before.

After speaking to him, he told me he wouldn't be upset if I went on my own so I have two questions:

1. Should I buy the VIP tickets that are $160 or should I wait until closer to the show and maybe I can score them $100 cheaper?

2. Is it frowned upon to have your phone out and recording the show just for personal viewing? I don't plan on putting anything up anywhere online but I like to have stuff to look back on later. I know it's okay at some concerts if the performers don't get mad about it but I don't know if K&amp;G are annoyed by someone recording on their phone.

850,The DNA Genealogy True Crime Revolution Continues!,"I’ve been following this story for a while. I used to live in Alaska and it’s great to see some cold cases get solved. 

In 1993, 20 year old college student Sophie Sergie was murdered at the University of Fairbanks. An Alaskan Native woman, Sophie was visiting a friend in the dorms when she left their room to smoke a cigarette. Her friend suggested she smoke by a vent near the woman’s bathroom as it was too cold to go outside. She was never seen alive again. 

A custodial worker found Sophie’s body in a bathtub in the dorm where she vanished. She’d been sexually assaulted, stabbed multiple times, and finally shot in the back of the head. While DNA was collected from Sophie’s body no matches were found and the trail went cold.

That is, it went cold until this year. On February 15 Anchorage police announced that an arrest had been made. Steven Downs, a nurse now living in Maine was charged with Sophie’s death. He’d attended the University of Fairbanks from 1992 to 1996 and lived in the same dorm building at the time of the murder. He was tracked down due to a DNA sample his Aunt uploaded to the website GEDMatch and identified due to the hard work of CeCe Moore, a geneticist based in California. 

Just goes to show you that the capture of the Golden State Killer has just blasted the doors wide on this technology! Hopefully this means more cold cases will be solved and more killers brought to justice.

Hi murderinos! I searched around google, this sub and on the wikipedia and couldn't find anything, so figured I'd ask!

I'm trying to find a murder that was discussed on the show. It was probably about a year or two ago (ish), I'm not sure if it was Karen's or Georgia's.

It was a man and a woman who went to stay with their niece and then everyone (or multiple people?) were found murdered in the garage. I remember it being shocking because everyone thought the uncle was the nicest guy ever, but turns out he was a secret serial killer.

I want to look into it more because it's a really interesting one.

897,Hometown Too Sad for MFM,"Most hometowns they read these days are lighthearted and short, but I think the world should hear my insane tale. I have a story to share that involves a psycho frat boy, kitties, an escape room game, myself, and a Facebook message.   
Before I get too ahead of myself, let me give you some background information. My name is Ashlyn, I’m a 22 year old recent college grad, and I live in a small college town in Alabama called Montevallo. It’s a beautiful little place full of liberals, gays, artists, and cats. Two years before I moved here, the University of Montevallo was terrorized by the Montevallo Cat Killer. In 2012, someone went around the campus publicly displaying the bodies of dismembered cats. One of the cats was strung up the flagpole in the center of campus, one was left on a famous University sculpture, and another was displayed on the lawn of the University president’s house. The cats had been tortured and drowned. This was obviously the work of a psychopath/probable dog person. It was discovered that the killer was a 19 year old student, frat guy, and part-time campus groundskeeper named Christian Slaton. He was caught by police after he wrote a letter to his dad describing his crimes and saying that, if he didn’t get enough attention, his next victim would be female. His father called the police to turn him in. When the police arrived at his apartment, they found another dead cat in the woods behind his apartment, as well as in his bathtub where he had been drowning them. Apparently, he began the killing after a bad breakup with his girlfriend, who was in the same sorority as I was.   
He ended up being tried as a minor for first degree cruelty to cats, and, from what I understand, he did not face jail time. He was banned from the city of Montevallo.  
I wasn’t sure if I should send this in or not since it didn’t really fit the usual interests, but I thought people might find it uncomfortably interesting. That’s why, in November, when I met a girl who was close friends with his ex-girlfriend, I made her tell me everything she knew. She told me that Slaton had changed his name and moved east to one of those states over there, and she gave me his new, secret name. In true murderino fashion, I went home and found his new identity on Instagram. To call his account creepy would be an understatement. One of his recent pictures was of him posing with his new girlfriend who was wearing a cat costume on Halloween. That’s quality irony! It also showed a picture of the new business he had just opened. No joke, this dude is the proud new owner of a fucking Escape Room game business! I was mesmerized, and I wanted to be able to show my friends, so I followed his account. I guess I thought I was invisible or something, even though my Instagram bio at the time clearly included my college and my sorority letters (same sorority as his ex girlfriend’s). I woke up the next morning to a follow request from him. I regretted everything and blocked him immediately. Hours later, he went through the effort of finding me on Facebook. Then he sent me this message. It said, “Hey, Ashlyn! I can’t help but notice that you followed me on Instagram and then promptly disappeared. I can also see that you are at Montevallo, so I assume that must be how we know each other. I just wanted to see if you had anything you wanted to ask me or talk about. If not, no worries! Just extending the offer. Cheers!📷” Yeah, I felt very safe and secure when I opened a Facebook message from my town’s known cat torturer. Plus, it seemed like he wanted to tell me all about it. Again, I regretted my life’s choices, and I blocked him. I was DUMB, but I at least got a good story out of it.

911,“Scary” book recommendations,"Hi everyone!

I know we get a thread like this every week, but I started a reading challenge and hoping to read a book a week or so for the rest of the year! 

I have either read or added to my amazon list most likely all of the true crime/other books that were mentioned on the podcast. 

Been reading a few fictional thrillers but not getting the heebie-jeebies as much, which I am surprisingly missing as a single girl living by herself. Im also getting a little tired of guessing and being right on the whodunnits in my mystery books. 

Looking for some recommendations along the true crime genre (also fictionalized if it is good) that can range from creepy to don’t read this at night alone. Also ones that had crazy endings that you couldn’t guess, etc. 

 I read “I’ll be gone in the dark” prior to the GSK getting caught and that freaked me out a little where I couldn’t read it at night. 

Interested in any and all recommendations! I’m on book 4/52 for this year. A little behind, but can easily catch up if I’m interested in the topics. 🙂

I was appalled people not only had the gall to do that but that today people were still complaining about it. 

The Amber Alert was issued for an 11 year old girl whose father had said he was going to hurt himself and daughter. Unfortunately, he murdered his daughter before he was arrested. They found the daughter and made the arrest directly because of a tip from the Amber Alert. 

People are so concerned that they may have lost sleep while there is a mother out there who lost her sweet baby angel. Unfortunately, that is not a sentiment shared in those forums.

943,Criticism and the undeniable recline,"* decline lol sorry

Ok hi so I, like many others haven't been liking episodes the past few weeks. I get really frustrated because it feels like recording is a chore for K&amp;G now, compared to their old episodes I just can't get into the new ones most of the time. Yadda Yadda... we've heard it. 

Anyway ,my issue is that whenever I see someone else commenting on this or giving any sort of negative (but respectful) critique to mfm/k&amp;g their posts get brutally downvoted and they meet with backlash of ""IT'S FREE SO DON'T COMPLAIN"" or ""STFU AND JUST STOP LISTENING THEN"". 
And I don't get it because we have the right to state our opinion, especially when a lot of us really love(d) the podcast and we're just disappointed. I don't see anyone slandering K&amp;G or giving any random hate and yet this community seems to have a problem with feedback that's anything other than ass-kissing. 

And btw it's not free, we listen to ca 5 ads per episode, buy merch, etc. So as consumers we should have the right to express our opinion without the fear of being attacked for it . 
Idk maybe I'm the only one who finds it very toxic to not be able to say one bad word without the backlash.

I’m hoping y’all can help me find a specific episode, it’s an old one and the details that I can remember are vague at best;

It was about a woman that was murdered by her husband, I believe he shot her in their home and her parents were really weird about it and kinda sided with him and said that they really loved him and that she must’ve pushed him to it if I remember rightly. 

I listened to Dirty John when it first came out and I’ve just been watching the TV show, the murder of Cindi Newell/Vickers reminded me of the case that K&amp;G discusses... I think it’s a pretty old episode.

Any help would be hugely appreciated!

Something I have been doing daily for a few months is my 'greatfuls'.

We started in group therapy and I have continued every night.

You write down three things you are greatful for (could be micro or macro, about yourself or the world) and then something you did well that day, and something you could have done better.

It has been shown that reflecting on things that you are greatful for has a very profound effect on your mental health and happiness! A similar effect as meditation. 

So, anyone who wants to join me in doing their daily 'Fucking Hooray's should please do so!
