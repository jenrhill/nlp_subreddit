Ok if this is really this kid and he was being held captive then I DO NOT think that his mother committed suicide.

I don't know enough to say for sure but I did not think slashing your throat was a typical suicide route, especially for women.

Additionally, in her suicide note it says her son is being taken care of and they will never find him...yet the car seat was never removed from the car and her cell phones was missing from the scene...and she had family she could've left him with.

Suspicious death in my house before I moved in?!? Need sleuth tips!,"Hey guys, if you found out that there had been a suspicious death at **your** house a few years before you moved in, and the **whole town knew** about it, and you knew it was at **YOUR** house, and there appeared to have been an aggressive effort to scrub the information from the internet... where would you **start**?

It started as a neighbor saying they'd heard it, then I heard other parents at my child's school were joking about it at the pickup area, then another neighbor confirmed something happened but he didn't know the details. Part of the rumor was that someone running for local office witnessed the death, and so they arranged to have news sites remove it from their feeds.

I live in a very small town that doesn't have its own obituaries, and if I perform Google News searches I get some **odd** echoes of important key words on spam websites, but nothing **real**. For instance, I'm finding that if I Google certain keywords like my address + the cause of death, I see dozens of spam websites have my address and half-sentences about death scrambled into them, but no coherent websites. I've seen this in the past, where a news story gets diluted to spam sites and affiliate sites, but I've never seen the main article scrubbed. If I say, change it to my neighbor's address, Google has zero results. Clearly at some point my address was in the news!

Should I call the police and ask about public records?",myfavoritemurder,4

Stay sexy and get the help you need,"Throw away account because of embarrassment

This isn't murder related but I feel like this community is full of awesome, understanding people who support each other and can maybe relate to this so here we go...

I've lived with anxiety and depression at some level for a long time. Therapy has been something I've thought about off and on but have never pursued. Lately things have gotten worse. I had a baby 18 months ago and had some postpartum depression that I didn't get help for. I'm handling the stress of motherhood terribly and generally hate myself. 

Listening to Karen and Georgia be so open and honest about therapy has really given me a big push towards getting some help. However, I'm scared shitless to actually go get started. So what I'm asking from this wonderful community is people's personal experience with therapy and what it has done for you. Karen and Georgia have helped me realize that going to therapy is a lot more normal than I thought...I just need that extra push!

"Not murder related, but mental health related","Hey murderinos! 

So recently I‚Äôve been feeling kinda lost in life and I started thinking about things Karen and Georgia have mentioned over the course of the podcast. In particular Georgia talking about having a job she hated, been there.. for 5 years. I don‚Äôt remember which episode it was but I remember Georgia saying she was so unhappy that she started thinking ‚Äúmaybe if I had a baby I could have some time off.‚Äù And honestly? Same. The thought crossed my mind a few times. 

Anyways Georgia said one of the ways she got through it was by starting a blog and I was wondering.. is it still available to the public? I would love to read it knowing how unhappy she was and how much her life has changed for the better.

Also, at some point during the podcast, I think it was Karen, said something like ‚Äúfeeling like things are never going to get better is just proof that it will.‚Äù  Has anyone had experience with this? It would be great to hear some stories about being young and feeling like everything sucks and it‚Äôs never going to get better and then  later in life having everything completely change and you can look back and be grateful for what you have now.

"Chicago Ripper Crew member, Thomas Kokoraleis, released from prison","So I can't believe, as someone who lives in the Chicago suburbs, that I have never heard of these fuckfaces. Four dudes in a creeper van started themselves up a satanic cult and went around killing and torturing women, cutting off their breasts, and doing.....things.....to the holes. One of them was executed, two will be in prison likely for the rest of their lives, but this Thomas Kokoraleis guy just got out on Friday and will be living in Wheaton, IL. There's a short documentary about them on YouTube: https://youtu.be/9_huhjJ6nrQ

The doc is pretty good (and features Dr. Badass Katherine Ramsland) and also discusses how a SURVIVOR was able to identify one of the men. They talk about what this woman went through and it is truly the fucking worst thing ever.

Support for crime victims,"Hi.

I‚Äôm looking for friends who have experienced being a crime victim. Some days, it‚Äôs harder than others. 

Yesterday, I learned some facts that have left me a bit despondent. 

1. It takes 5-7 years for crime victims to truly heal. I‚Äôm just over two years into my trauma therapy and this just broke me. I don‚Äôt know that I can take more years of being this lonely and feeling misunderstood as I live with this PTSD.

2. Many crime victims become revictimized. This has happened to me. 

-The original crime was in Sept 2016, first trial Dec 2016, second (his appeal) trial Feb 2017. 
-my business was burglarized in May 2018.
-finally filed charges in a new incident against a stalker in Sept 2018 (I was in denial that I was being stalked beginning in Dec 2017, because court was sooo traumatic the first time around.).

Anyway, I‚Äôm looking for hope. Looking for support. My friends, well, they don‚Äôt exactly get it. A few of them live with trauma or PTSD, but not as a result of being a crime victim and/or not having their constitutional rights upheld in court, which is also something I experienced with the first crime. 

How do I stop being victimized? I‚Äôm so tired. I feel like there is a target on my back that says, ‚Äúyo, fuck with this one.‚Äù I have words, I‚Äôm articulate, I address safety threats immediately. I don‚Äôt understand why stupid stuff is still happening. 

And I‚Äôm really lonely. 

I‚Äôve perused and comment on things on r/cptsd , r/ptsd and have yet to find a place where crime victims are supported. Figured I would post here since I listen to the podcast and have heard the community is baller. ",myfavoritemurder,4
Help me find a case mentioned in a hometown story?,"
Hey everyone, I hope someone can help me remember this case. I am fairly sure (thanks to reddit!) I heard it as a home town story in a minisode of MFM, but I can‚Äôt find the case name or find the episode again of the life of me.

Details I am sure of:

A girl went missing as a teenager. Several years later (15 or so) her adult body was found i.e she had been alive, and never found, from the time she was went missing until shortly before the body was found.

Details I am not so sure are correct - could be red herrings:

She was jogging when she went missing, maybe in a park or wooded area, or in her neighbourhood. She might have been on a school sports team.

She disappeared in the 1990s and her body was found in the 2000s.

Her whole body may not have been found - it might have been only a part or otherwise found dismembered.

The body was found on the side of the road / a highway.

There was speculation she had been kept in captivity, as a slave / sex slave, or sold into slavery.

Something about a tattoo or brand.

Something about a piece of furniture being relevant to her body being found.

I hope someone can help with the episode or any details of the case. Thanks!",myfavoritemurder,2

My Mom Helped Execute a Serial Killer (Nebraska // Hometown Murder),"Hi everyone!

I had the amazing pleasure of seeing Karen and Georgia during their tour when they came to the Orpheum Theatre here in Omaha, Nebraska! A week or so before the show I had sent in this hometown murder and thought the murderinos here could possibly appreciate it as well! 

I live in Omaha Nebraska and I‚Äôm a college student with an internship as an Autopsy Assistant. This position has taught me so much and given me so many amazing stories to share - but that‚Äôs for another day. This story is about my Mother. A badass, cancer surviving Sheriff‚Äôs Deputy who was a part of the case in finding and executing a world-class-piece-of-shit-serial-killer. 

John Joseph Joubert IV, aka The Nebraska Boy Snatcher was born in Lawrence, MA. In 1982, Joubert took the life of his first victim, 11 year old Richard Stetson. The boy‚Äôs body was found undressed, stabbed and strangled. In 1983, Joubert moved to Nebraska where he proceeded to torture, molest and murder two more precious baby angels. 

On December 2, 1983 the body of Christopher Walden was found by my badass mother and the rest of her team in a grassy field in Papillion, NE. His throat was cut so deeply he was almost decapitated. Due to being on scene of the discovery, my Mom and her partner became the individuals who went and told the Walden family that their 12 year old boy had been found. 

In 1984 a preschool teacher called the police saying she saw a young man driving in the area. When the driver saw the teacher writing down his license plate, he stopped and threatened her before fleeing. The license plate was traced and found to be rented by John Joubert, an enlisted radar technician from Offutt Air Force Base. It turned out that his own car was being repaired. A search warrant was issued, and rope consistent with that used to bind the first boy found in NE, Danny Joe Eberle, was found in his barracks room. 

Robert K. Ressler, the FBI's head profiler at the time, had immediate access to the information about the two boys in Nebraska and worked up a description which matched Joubert. While he was presenting the case of the two Nebraska boys to a training class at the FBI academy at Quantico, a police officer from Portland, Maine noted the similarities to a case in his jurisdiction which took place while Joubert lived there prior to joining the Air Force. Bite-mark comparisons proved that Joubert was responsible for the Maine killing in addition to those in Nebraska. Ressler and the Maine investigators came to believe that Joubert joined the military to get away from Maine after the murder of the Stetson boy. 

Joubert then confessed to killing the two boys, and on January 12, 1984, he was charged with their murders. After several psychiatric evaluations it was found he had OCD, sadistic tendencies and suffered from schizoid personality disorder -  He was found to have been not psychotic at the time of the crimes. Joubert was executed by the state of Nebraska, (14 days after I was born) on July 17, 1996 by the electric chair. He was the second person executed in Nebraska since the death penalty was reintroduced in the state in 1973. 

This case has always affected my Mom in many ways since she was so closely attached to it. Growing up, from a young age I was taught to fuck politeness and not talk to strangers or wander too far from the house alone. The field where Christopher Walden was found was on the way to my dance studio when I was little and the only constructive criticism I give my mother would be to not tell your 7 year old daughter that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where we found the body!‚Äù On her way to ballet. One of my Mom‚Äôs classic phrases of my childhood was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad we got that fucker to fry.‚Äù 

If you made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read this novel and hearing a little bit about my Mom‚Äôs badass career.

Stay sexy &amp; avoid telling your 7 year old daughter about serial killers on the way to ballet!

"I almost got kidnapped yesterday. They pretended to be my brother. I went there but the car vanished. Today, we checked the schools cameras footage and we saw the car. We told the police. I am scared. I am 15.","**Yesterday:**

while I was hanging out after school with my friends, we were still near school (a place we always hang out). a girl (classmate) came to me and said ''your brother told me to tell you that he is waiting behind the school for you''. I swear I was about to get up when I realized that my brother can easily call me on the phone? I called my brother, he wasn't answering (he was at work). we asked the girl how the guy she saw looks like. She told me and everything she said was how my brother typically looks like. She also said that he was in his car. She said that she was leaving school and he called her. At that time I thought, maybe its him.

My friends told me to go with all of us (we were 3+ that girl) it was weird situation, maybe it was my brother, it was just weird situation. I decided to go with them to see who that person was but there was no car anymore? I kept on calling my brother. Finally, my brother answered and he said that he never came to my school today.

The girl was so sure that there was a guy searching for me because he gave her my name, class and he even mentioned the colour of my hair. The most suspicious is that the girl was my classmate too, I mean how did he pick my classmate ? how did he know she knows me and knows where I hang out? Also I am even suspicious of the girl, I mean why help him? but maybe because I am her classmate she helped him? I am confused.

I called my father to pick me up.

**Today:**

There was truly someone that pretended to be my brother. Me and my father went to the principle today and we even checked the school camera footage. There was a car, we couldnt see his face and the plate number but everything my classmate said was true, there was really someone that lied about being my brother. We went to the police, we told them everything, my classmate told them how the guy looked like. The police said they will make sure to drive by our house and school everyday (guarding).

I am scared, i started to sleep with my brother LOL but i dont want to sleep alone :(

TRUE CRIME FEST FT. Billy Jensen and Paul Holes,"I hope this post is allowed!! I know it isn't explicitly MFM but it's Billy Jensen &amp; Paul Holes content!

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g3oa9xsacpn21.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

I know the audience was packed with Murderinos last night at Gramercy Theater in NYC for True Crime Fest!! For anyone who wasn't able to make it or didn't know about it, Billy Jensen gave a little talk last night on his new book *Chase Darkness with Me*, and was interviewed by none other than Paul Holes himself! He gave a few shout outs to the murderinos in the crowd (in which almost the entire room erupted in yelling &amp; clapping because, duh) and I saw so many of my fellow NY bbs decked out with their best MFM gear! The show was amazing, I can't wait for the book annnd the podcast (s/o to the person in the audience who yelled out ""THATS EXACTLY RIGHT!""), and Billy even had a small meet &amp; greet at the end. Of course I lined up and we all got Citizen Detective diplomas and a few of us came prepared with our copies of *I'll be Gone in the Dark*. It was basically staged like a graduation ceremony where you got your diploma, walked across the stage, shook Billy's hand, and your photo was taken. And just like I did with my own graduation, due to my severe stage fright and social anxiety I completely blacked out the second I started walking across that stage to take photos with him + have him sign my book BUT he did see my ""MURDERINO"" shirt and signed my book the best way possible and I wanted to share it with you all!!! I also attached photos of the cute af diplomas they gave away, too.

&amp;#x200B;

For everyone wondering, he is as nice and sincere as I had hoped and dreamed he would be. He even mingled at the bar for a little bit after and let me pull him aside to tell him about my own Hometown Murder that he wrote down in his phone to look into. So nice, so sweet, so dark, so tallll!!!

Despite some continuity fluxes between some of the books, it's a neat series, and it seems like the kind of story that would fascinate Karen and Georgia if it happened in real life.

Tonight I took the dogs out and the boys were fixated on something in the yard. It was a piece of pizza, like full piece besides what they had already eaten before I got out to them. Now I‚Äôm worried someone poisoned my pups.

What do I do? Should I call the non emergency line? Should I make a report of this? I‚Äôm so frustrated because it doesn‚Äôt seem like much, but is definitely something deliberate. This for sure isn‚Äôt helping my anxiety.

Note: I have had one issue with neighbors caddy corner from me in the back. The neighbors were in their backyard carrying on being loud and when my dogs went outside, my dogs were barking at them. This was mid day. But I overheard them saying ‚Äúlooks like I‚Äôm gonna have to grill up some dog tonight‚Äù and other weird ass shit. I didn‚Äôt report it or anything just figuring it was drunk shenanigans but it def rubbed me the wrong way.

Murderino WWYD?,"I was driving home from work for my lunch hour when I spotted a dude beating the holy hell out of his girl in her van....I stopped right away and called the cops, but didn't intervene because who knows what the guy had and he was bigger than me and I'm an old fucking lady. Now, I live in a major metropolis in Michigan, if you get my meaning. I sat there for 10 minutes on the corner, no cops ever came. Poor girl finally managed to shove him out of the van and get the door shut. He punched out the drivers side window and she peeled off.

What could I have done differently to help the poor thing?! I can't imagine how scared she must have been, and the fucking cops never even bothered to show up???",myfavoritemurder,12

I was listening to the mini-sode where the writer described her father going on a date with an undercover investigator because, unknowing to him, he was a suspect in a murder investigation! Funny story.

I checked my etix email and it says I'm not able to view my tickets until May 4th. It also, obviously, states that they can't be resold for reasons X, Y, and Z.

But I know people have sold theirs off. I've never had to, but if it comes down to it, how do I sell mine?

&amp;#x200B;

So my gf works at a BBB and tonight an older man(70's) approached her. He said to her ""Do you know this girl?"" while he is pulling out a photo from his wallet. The photo was of her with her named typed on it. She said her face went pale and was immediately uncomfortable and creeped out. She can't recall how she responded. He slid the photo back into his wallet and proceeded to pull out a business card saying that ""if you need help with things around the house, I help out some women around my neighborhood"". Just super weird. She took the card and he walked off. Never bought any item in the store just intentionally seemed to seek her out. She called the police to file a report and told her managers of duty of what happened. The managers didn't seem concerned. Meanwhile, she is still really traumatized and doesn't know what to do or think.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think of all this? PS- She remembers him from about a month or two ago. He was asking about this strange tiny camera that he had on him and if bed bath had any parts for it. Which is bullshit bc they don't sell anything like that. Little did she know that he snuck a picture of her in that moment and this is the exact photo he showed her today.

"Jazz It! 100 yr anniversary of the Axeman, Tuesday","Just saw the Buzzfeed Unsolved episode for the Axeman of New Orleans on YouTube and realized the night proposed in the letter is exactly 100 years, even matching the day of the week, this next Tuesday, March 19, 2019. So don't forget to 'Jazz It' at 12:15 (earthly time) next Tuesday night!

The letter was published March 13, so I'm not able to give quite as much warning, but to refresh your memory:

Hell, March 13, 1919

Esteemed Mortal of New Orleans:The Axeman


They have never caught me and they never will. They have never seen me, for I am invisible, even as the ether that surrounds your earth. I am not a human being, but a spirit and a demon from the hottest hell. I am what you Orleanians and your foolish police call the Axeman.

When I see fit, I shall come and claim other victims. I alone know whom they shall be. I shall leave no clue except my bloody axe, besmeared with blood and brains of he whom I have sent below to keep me company.

If you wish you may tell the police to be careful not to rile me. Of course, I am a reasonable spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.

Undoubtedly, you Orleanians think of me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but I could be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay thousands of your best citizens (and the worst), for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.

Now, to be exact, at 12:15 (earthly time) on next Tuesday night, I am going to pass over New Orleans. In my infinite mercy, I am going to make a little proposition to you people. Here it is:

I am very fond of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band is in full swing at the time I have just mentioned. If everyone has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.

Well, as I am cold and crave the warmth of my native Tartarus, and it is about time I leave your earthly home, I will cease my discourse. Hoping that thou wilt publish this, that it may go well with thee, I have been, am and will be the worst spirit that ever existed either in fact or realm of fancy.

A small kindness.,"It occurred to me today that the word ""book"" in an acronym of ""best of our knowledge."" I think that's pretty cool. I'm sure I didn't exactly split the atom with this one, but it made me smile. I wanted to share it with someone and, in the absence of walky-talky friends, I submit it to the murderinos. 

There's a larger picture here, though. I got sober a few years ago, then botched a suicide attempt a year later, and the one thing that has kept me going more than anything else is a childlike sense of wonder. The future can be terrifying, and the past may be monstrous, so I stay dialed in with what's going on around me and let a little bit of light shine through. Make eye contact with a squirrel, talk back to birds, laugh at any of the thousands of small mistakes I make navigating through my day. Being my own worst critic, I try to give myself the same latitude that I'd give to anyone else just once a day. 

It's only by doing myself small kindness that I've been able to keep my head above water. It took me three days to be ok with sharing this, but I kept at it because I know that for every thousand people that scroll past this or scoff at sincerity, there might be one person who's hanging on by a thread that this will get through to.  If you've read this far, I know you're in real pain. You're not alone. Try to do one nice thing for yourself today without agonizing over it, because you're allowed be nice to yourself.

It's the one in which a little girl (the daughter of cops, I think) pulled a gun on a burgler.  Afterward, Karen and Georgia were imagining the girl sliding over the back of the couch and riffing on how she would have sounded with braces or a  retainer telling the burglar to freeze.

How Some Girl Puking Led Us to Meeting Georgia!,"Last night a group of my friends and I went to the Las Vegas MFM show at the park theater! (Shout out if you were there!) The show was obviously amazing, but what happened the rest of the night can only be described as fate. 
We were sitting up in the balcony section 405 and the girls behind us were talking loudly so I politely turned around and asked them to please keep it down. After a while, and a little bit more noise from the girls, we hear the girl say ""I think I just got thrown up on!"" We turn around and sure enough, some other chick threw right up on the girls directly behind us. Ew. 
We thought it was super gross but whatever, we weren't going to let it ruin our time. So during the end when they brought out Rosa from Brooklyn nine-nine, the girl who was thrown up on came back and she was bawling her eyes out apologizing for everything that happened. We told her we were sorry for what happened to her and just struck up a conversation. We ended up chatting in the theater until we were asked to leave. At that point we had collected a few of other new friends and decided to go grab food at Nacho Daddy (cause Georgia was talking about Nachos) 
We hung out for quite some time and had a blast then walked back to the theater to go our separate ways. We were just about to push the 'request' button on Lyft, when my sister said she had to use the restroom. So we walked in to take a quick trip to the ladies room all the while talking about how our night exceed expectations. As we were checking out our hair and makeup the beautiful Georgia Hardstark herself came up to wash her hands in the sink right next to us! We kept our cool and said thank you for the show, briefly told her out story, and gave her a giant hug! It was amazing! 
We are so grateful that we had the chance to experience this huge gathering of Murderinos, and getting to hug and thank Georgia face to face was just a beyond incredible way to top it off.

"The Keepers Documentary- murder of Cathy Sezneck, a Catholic Nun","Has anyone else seen the documentary The Keepers that tells the story of Cathy Sezneck, a catholic nun in Baltimore? Inside it exhibits that 

1) someone is pulling a coverup to protect the Catholic Church and  

2) the absolute incompetence of the Baltimore police is not only embarrassing but unacceptable. How do you log evidence in an ongoing murder investigation and then suddenly have zero record of it? You don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs not what happens. That‚Äôs what a cover up looks like.

I grew up in Edmonton, Alberta and lived there until I moved after high school. I‚Äôm in the arts and one of my friends who is also in the arts once told me that she was cast in a small local movie that has never been released due to it being used as evidence in a murder case. Obviously I had to hear more about it and eventually found out that she had been cast, and shot scenes as, the main character‚Äôs daughter in the ‚Äúcopycat‚Äù film (House of Cards) that Mark Twitchell had made which depicted the crime he eventually committed. This was when she was about 8 or 9 and she was just CASUALLY being directed by a future killer.

Current events hometown murder!!!,"Happening right now in the Boston/Providence area...I'll leave a link below but basically this guy Louis Coleman was outside a nightclub in Boston and met this girl Jassy Correia and she got into his car willingly around 2am. Two hours later he got to his apartment in Providence (it should be about a 1 hour drive) and carried her limp body into his buliding and once inside, dragged her into his apartment. There is later footage of him buying things like surgical gloves, scented candles, duct tape, Tyvex suits, goggles, CLN release bleach bath at Walmart, and a large suitcase. They pulled him over later in Delaware and her naked, bruised body was found stuffed inside a couch cushion cover in a garbage bag in the suitcase in his trunk, covered in baking soda (to absorb the smell). Also in his car were things like garbage bags, charcoal air purifies, air fresheners, safety glasses, pliers, disinfectant, a butane lighter, and long-handled pruners. 

&amp;#x200B;

When they were looking for him there were a bunch of helicopters downtown in Providence which was crazy to see. Also, he played in a volleyball league with a bunch of people I know who were all really surprised to find out he was the culprit- they all said he was really nice and normal-seeming.

The Curious Case of the Missing Subtenant,"***UPDATE***

They FINALLY found her - she‚Äôs ok, she was fucking MIA bc she realized she didn‚Äôt have enough money for rent and couldn‚Äôt pay. Apparently she assured the ex she would handle rent money this month, but overspent by a long shot and then became unreachable instead of letting anybody know what was going on. Oy. 

I finally got all of my rent money yesterday. The ex bf has to get a loan from his work and she had to get a loan somehow too. Hopefully this is the last I have to deal with them until the lease ends in August...

*Original post*

Currently dealing with this and can‚Äôt help but think the murderinos would be interested in joining me on this wild ride. 

So back in August I got a great new job in an awesome new city about 4.5 hours away from the crappy city I was living in. The problem is, I had already resigned my lease for my apartment, and couldn‚Äôt get out of it so the leasing company suggest I sublease. Since it‚Äôs a college town, it wasn‚Äôt too hard to find some subtenants - a bf and a gf moving in together. I had them sign a contract essentially saying that they agree to the terms of the master lease and if they fail to abide by those terms and end up getting evicted, they are still legally obligated to pay for rent throughout the rest of the term of the master lease (ends this August).

Fast forward to today. They haven‚Äôt been great subtenants, but I usually don‚Äôt have to deal with them too much. Until now when I find out they haven‚Äôt paid rent for March yet. I also found out that they broke up and she‚Äôs not living there anymore, yet she supposedly has the rent money for March according to him. However her phone supposedly broke, so I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of her and the bf told me he can‚Äôt get a hold of her either and hasn‚Äôt seen her in days. 

It‚Äôs been a few days of trying to reach her, so finally I fb stalked and reached out to her sister, to see if she had a suggestion for how to get in touch. Her sister said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs weird because I haven‚Äôt heard from her in awhile either‚Äù so she called their mom. Their mom also hasn‚Äôt heard anything from her even though the parents live right outside the city, and I was under the impression the girl was living with her parents until her new lease starts in May. So the sister responded to me saying the mom is worried and was going to call the girl‚Äôs work, and that she would get back to me as soon as the mom called her back. This was at 10 AM this morning, and I still haven‚Äôt heard anything. 

So, not only am I out of March rent and waiting to figure out wtf to do, I also am worried about this girl‚Äôs whereabouts bc apparently v few people have heard from her in the last couple of days...",myfavoritemurder,13

Namely Jack the ripper which was the first example I could think of and the black dahlia (wasn't sure about time until i googled). So what did they call them before? When you goog JTR it just says widely know serial killer, that wasn't a term then since it was 1888 so spree killer? ",myfavoritemurder,0

Need help: how to get rid of murder stool,"Okay, I'll get right into this:

&amp;#x200B;

My ex-boyfriend violently murdered a woman last year (not ready to talk about it\*).  
He lived with me for a short time, and although I never keep anything from exes,  I forgot that this stool I'd been using was something he'd built.  
His signature is on the bottom.

I grew up agnostic, I don't believe in cursed objects.  
However, this stool, aka the ""bad vibes bench"" has had some weird shit going on, and I need to get rid of it.
**(EDIT: of the weird shit that happened, I climbed on my kitchen table and tried to throw it to the ground to smash it and it landed at a bizarre angle on a *pillow* ‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt a passive drop; if it had landed on a bean bag, it still would not have frozen on contact like that. This was the point where I set it outside)**


&amp;#x200B;

I can't just give it away to another person if it *is* cursed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked a catholic friend who recommended the priest + holy water routine, but I'm afraid to call a priest because 1. It feels silly and 2. I'm afraid they'll think it's a prank, and I don't want to be disrespectful.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked an acquaintance if they have a fire pit I could burn it in, they said yes, but that plan keeps falling through.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone else said ""if he signed it, there's people on ebay that would definitely buy it"" but then I feel kind of weird morally, collecting profit related to the death of someone's loved one, y'know? 

&amp;#x200B;

It needs to GO, but I don't feel comfortable just unceremoniously ditching it by a dumpster. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO,

**What do I do with this?**

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**ADDENDUM**

This sub is *My Favorite Murder*, I‚Äôm not just going to casually drop the ‚ÄúI-dated-and-lived-with-a-murderer‚Äù and follow it up with ‚Äúps never acknowledge this; I refuse to talk about it, *how dare you*‚Äù 

I know if I was in a different position I‚Äôd get a bag of popcorn and settle in for the story.

Word on the pod is that the mfm fam is exceedingly kind/supportive/virtuous, etc., which is why I came here for the (seriously appreciated!) advice.

An uncomfortable interaction,"I wanted to post this here because I feel like you guys would understand/relate the most to how I‚Äôm feeling. First time poster, long time lurker, and if formatting comes off weird sorry I‚Äôm on mobile. Some backstory, I‚Äôm a gay, mid 20‚Äôs female who lives in what would be considered the country in a big farmhouse with elderly parents in the Midwest. 

Last night I had a guy friend stop by so I could get him the money that I had owed him for some items he had picked up for me. Now this guy is a coworker of my aunts so I trust him enough to be alone around him and whatnot, he‚Äôs a mid 20‚Äôs male himself. He texts he‚Äôs on his way and says ‚ÄòI‚Äôll be there in 15 sexy‚Äù. Should have been my first red flag but I‚Äôm stupid. He pulls into my driveway and I go outside and get in his car because it‚Äôs freezing out and I don‚Äôt like people in the house, and he‚Äôs on the phone with one of his friends when he tells them ‚ÄúI gotta go I got a thick ass girl in my car‚Äù red flag #2. I‚Äôm already starting to panic etc., when I hand him the money and he asks if I missed him. I kinda laugh and tell him ‚Äúyou know I‚Äôm gay right‚Äù and, of course, I get the ‚Äòso what‚Äô. He puts his hand on my thigh and starts talking about how ‚Äòthick‚Äô I am/ if I ever want a man to ‚Äòrub me down‚Äô to call him. And at this point I‚Äôm in 100% panic mode and just want out of the car. I give him the money, get the stuff he had for me and get out when he tells me to call him if I get lonely. I just feel so creeped out and disgusted by this guy because he‚Äôs a good friend of my aunts and has always been civil to me before this, plus he knows where I live is secluded from civilization, and I essentially live alone. 

I just wanted to vent to somebody about it and I knew all of you would understand. I ordered a thing of pepper spray last night right after this happened but I‚Äôm so freaked out I‚Äôm considering maybe a small rifle or shotgun for home protection. I hate that I don‚Äôt even feel safe in my own home right now. And I hate that I put myself in this position by letting him come to my house. ",myfavoritemurder,18

Trying to remember which episode.....,"Had a woman who went on dates with sex offenders to get their DNA.....her husband was identified incorrectly by a surviving child victim as the killer. 

As I remember it a grandmother and grand daughter were alone in a rural house the grandmother was assaulted and killed. And I forget if the child was attacked and left for dead or just hid but the next morning the girl went next door for help, was left on the porch for 45 minutes before being taken to the police to report the crime.  The girl said the attacker looked like her unkle, he was picked up and arrested. 

The wife believed her husband and not her niece and decided to take on her own investigation since the police had a witness and conviction. 

She went on the sex registry and found sex offenders in the area, went on dates with them to get their dna from beer bottles etc. froze them and had them tested.....didn‚Äôt find anything UNTIL....she worked out that a common law husband of that neighbor the kid ran to, was a sex offender and had just been released just before the crime was committed! And he was currently in prison with her husband! She got her husband to get some DNA from the inmate, smuggled it out of prison and had it tested.....it was a match!

&amp;#x200B;

Episode description from the podcast's website: Work hard on something you love for long enough and two things are bound to happen: you master it, and you stop caring about anything not directly related to how much you love that thing. If nothing else, that may be the most important lesson Karen Kilgariff has to offer. Starting out as a stand up in the early 1990's, she went on to become the head writer of¬†*The Rosie Show*,¬†*The Ellen Degeneres Show*, and¬†*The Pete Holmes Show*. After battling addiction, anxiety, and insecurity, Karen has reached a point in her career where she is able to look beyond the stress and struggles of trying to make it, leaving her with zero fucks left to give and one of the most successful podcasts in existence,¬†*My Favorite Murder.*¬†That mindset makes Karen the best possible person to unpack the uncompromising political statements and savage criticisms of modern romance that make up Gang of Four‚Äôs influential 1979 release¬†*Entertainment!*

Fascinating interrogation analysis videos,"I'm obsessed with this channel Jim Can't Swim, which does breakdowns of interrogations - he has an ongoing series on the very recent Chris Watts case: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfg861hO-Ag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfg861hO-Ag) 

It's like an extension of Georgia's fascination with listening to 911 calls to see if you can guess if they're guilty. I never realised the subtlety and skill in police interrogation tactics - AND the way suspects think they can outsmart them, even subsconsciously.

I'm watching the Jodi Arias (boo) interrogation video right now which you can get if you contribute to his Patreon and for one dollar it is so worth it (I promise this isn't an ad!). It's so creepy seeing her feign emotion when she thinks the interrogator is outside and then go back to normal when he doesn't appear. This also happens in Chris Watts' mistress' video and it's kind of sickening (even though I don't think she was involved in the murder): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AWmgbaf97I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AWmgbaf97I)

I think it'd be nice to share some of our favourite non-murder things to watch or listen to and maybe we can discover something new by that? Idk I hope it's not a lame idea.

meet and greet report and regrets.,"Thought to create a meet and greet report for others like me who are curious and it‚Äôs their first time.

**Process:** was pretty easy- we moved to another area of the theatre and waited in line. I was just past halfway and including the M&amp;G was out in an hour. As we got to the main door, a security guy took our merch/ jackets/bags and put them on a table near the door so we would be unencumbered during the photo. Vince takes all the photos, and as mentioned by other murderinos, he's very thorough, snapping pics from the second you see the ladies to your posed photo at the end. This is really a wonderful bonus.

**Karen and Georgia:** ARE SO NICE. They hug you immediately. Ask your name if you're too dazed like me and forget to introduce yourself. Listen to you and respond. Say cute things. Are the best.

**What I wanted to tell them:** I'm like every murderino and have loved true crime forever so thank you for this podcast and the community. You are both so great with your dynamic and your openness about your struggles. You seriously make me laugh every day. When in anxious moods, I often put on your podcast to melt it away. I feel like I've found two friends I have never actually met, and it's been amazing. THANK YOU. ps I live for Elvis' meow at the end of each show.

**Things that came out of my mouth instead:** ""HEY! I'm Armenian so loved the Zankou chicken story."" Karen said things here I don't remember. ""I don't have a gift for you so here's a photo of my pets! That's my dog and I listen to your show every day when I walk her."" Georgia points to my cat and maybe says something. I reply: ""yeah, that's my cat!"" (wtf.) ""Thanks for being my friend during those walks!"" Karen says something like ""thanks for being our friend,"" but again: I don't fucking remember. Then pose time and Vince is busy and I jokingly yell out ""we're waiting Vince!"" (Cringing at that today even though Georgia laughed.) Then I just smile and say ""bye"" and Georgia tells me to say hi to the pets for them.¬†

**My advice:** know what the hell you want to say in advance if there's something important you want to convey. I've done M&amp;G's before where I prepared in advance, but was too casual about this one. Found myself so suddenly nervous and them so friendly, but felt like I couldn't take too long and that it was all on fast forward.

That all being said, this was definitely a case of meeting one's heroes who turn out to be as marvellous as you imagined. So enjoy your time with them!¬† ¬†¬†",myfavoritemurder,19

Need Help! Wife is Big Murderino and lost Tote Bag at Detroit Show Friday,"Hi everyone. My wife is a huge Murderino and I need some help.

Long story short: She went to Fox Theater in Detroit Friday night for the Live show. After the show, she bought a tote bag that said ""Let me Tell You about My Hometown My Favorite Murder"" on it. We went walking downtown and she suddenly realized that she no longer had the tote bag. We retraced our steps, but could not find the bag.

I looked on the merch website and did not see the tote bag. Is there a way I can buy a new one? I don't care about shipping costs.

If there is a way for me to purchase the tote bag for her, I would greatly appreciated it. Thank you very much Murderinos.

MFM coincidence,"I decided to randomly look up videos on how to pronounce appalachia and found this woman explaining why it is so important that appalachia be pronounced as aap-a-LATCH-a. The weird coincidence is that her example for why it is important to her is if you're driving down the irish coast you see the town of derry/londonderry and whether you pronounce it derry or londonderry is a reflection of your respect for the country. It's a great short video if you're interested in watching but it's also just weird that both of these facts were brought up in the podcast!

Researching: Cases Where Family Played Key Role???,"Hey!

I am doing a report for school on specific types of cases. I am looking for cases that were solved because of the determination of someone connected to the case to find justice.

For example, the case of the murder of Judith Johnson. Clarence Elkins was identified as the murderer by his 5-year-old niece (who witnessed the murder) and was convicted. Eight years later, all thanks to the tireless work of his wife Molly, his innocence was proven and someone else was convicted of the murder. Molly KNEW he was innocent and wouldn't stop her quest for justice, even when Police had given up.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence\_Elkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Elkins)

Another example is the murder of Uta Von Schwedler. She was found dead in her bathtub, in what appeared to be a suicide. She left quite a sizeable inheritance to her son. Her son found the circumstances of his mother's death suspicious and poured money towards further investigation, and eventually hired the legal team that made sure his murdering father ended up in jail.

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2992217/Utah-doctor-guilty-murder-death-ex-wife.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2992217/Utah-doctor-guilty-murder-death-ex-wife.html)

Doesn't necessarily need to be a wrongful conviction, but cases where the persistence and determination of someone connected to the case lead to it being solved - even if it takes years!

Can anyone think of any other cases like this? Even cases where the family played a large role in the initial investigation would work.",myfavoritemurder,2

Can you reccomend a really representative episode?,"Hi Murderinos,

I'm recently getting into true crime, and it turns out I'm a huge fan. In my search for new podcasts, I've heard a lot of good things about MFM. However, I bounced off the first couple of episodes.

I don't know if it's a ""this podcast isn't for me"" thing or a ""this podcast hasn't hit it's stride"" thing or a ""I was expecting something else, but I'll like it when I'm expecting what it is"" thing. 

I did find the banter kind of off-putting, but I usually like banter in my podcasts - I think it was that I was expecting more introduction and instead got dropped into the middle of an ongoing conversation.

I'm hoping you lovely folks and recommend a good episode or two that highlight the best things about the podcast, the things you keep coming back for. I figure something that has this much of a fan base is worth trying to get into, but I don't want to power through 10 or 20 or 100 episodes only to discover that it's not for me, and never will be.

"Y‚Äôall, have any of you watched the doc ‚ÄúWithout Charity‚Äù?? I NEED YOUR THOUGHTS.","I just finished it, and I don‚Äôt even know what to think. I threw it on because it occurred in my home state, and I‚Äôd never heard about it. Without giving anything away, three construction workers were executed while on a job site that was the target of a burglary. The question, then became, what role did this 18 yo girl, Charity Payne, play in it. It turned out to be way more conflicting than I expected, and I might even say more heartbreaking. 

I didn‚Äôt get an Amanda Knoxian vibe, but I‚Äôm still not sure what I think of her innocence. (And so I call on my brilliant murderinos!)

If you haven‚Äôt seen it, I would 10/10 recommend! You get a lot of different perspectives from people directly/indirectly impacted by the crime, and I thought it did a nice job of making sure to keep the focus centered around the victims. (I did notice it focused on one victim/family the most, but I‚Äôm assuming that was due in part to reasons of the other victims‚Äô families.) It also makes you think about all the moral conundrums of crime and punishment and society.

Question for murderinos with young kids,"If I‚Äôm posting this in the wrong sub let me know. I don‚Äôt really post much. But I figured murderinos would be a good place to ask advice. 

So, I have three boys and then my youngest child is a girl. I have always tried to impress upon my boys that if another person tells you they want you out of their space to respect that, and really they‚Äôve gotten better about that as my daughter has gotten older. So recently my daughter started daycare for the first time (she‚Äôs five) and I wanted to make sure that she was confident in telling people ‚Äúno‚Äù in a situation that makes her uncomfortable. (She does that with her brothers all the time, but brothers don‚Äôt count.) so we went through various scenarios where things were or were not okay. The conversation led to me making sure that she knows she can always tell me if someone is pressuring her, or touching her when she doesn‚Äôt want it (even though I know 5 year olds are super picky about everything, like tickling, or even the whole ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not touching you‚Äô) and she asked if it was okay to tell me if they said not to. I told her ‚Äúabsolutely. You can tell me anything no matter what anyone says to you.‚Äù So my question, being raised in a house where ‚Äúbeing nice and polite‚Äù is what‚Äôs MOST important, am I setting her up for success like I‚Äôm trying to or pushing it too hard? I honestly don‚Äôt know. 
Also any advice for any future questions would be very much appreciated.

Buy VIP tix or wait until closer to the show?,"Hello!

I'd REALLY like to go to the show next month. However, I didn't get tickets when they were $40-60 and now they're sold out. :( Stupid, I know but I wanted to take my roommate with me and there weren't seats next to each other and I've never gone to a concert or anything like this before.

After speaking to him, he told me he wouldn't be upset if I went on my own so I have two questions:

1. Should I buy the VIP tickets that are $160 or should I wait until closer to the show and maybe I can score them $100 cheaper?

2. Is it frowned upon to have your phone out and recording the show just for personal viewing? I don't plan on putting anything up anywhere online but I like to have stuff to look back on later. I know it's okay at some concerts if the performers don't get mad about it but I don't know if K&amp;G are annoyed by someone recording on their phone.

The DNA Genealogy True Crime Revolution Continues!,"I‚Äôve been following this story for a while. I used to live in Alaska and it‚Äôs great to see some cold cases get solved. 

In 1993, 20 year old college student Sophie Sergie was murdered at the University of Fairbanks. An Alaskan Native woman, Sophie was visiting a friend in the dorms when she left their room to smoke a cigarette. Her friend suggested she smoke by a vent near the woman‚Äôs bathroom as it was too cold to go outside. She was never seen alive again. 

A custodial worker found Sophie‚Äôs body in a bathtub in the dorm where she vanished. She‚Äôd been sexually assaulted, stabbed multiple times, and finally shot in the back of the head. While DNA was collected from Sophie‚Äôs body no matches were found and the trail went cold.

That is, it went cold until this year. On February 15 Anchorage police announced that an arrest had been made. Steven Downs, a nurse now living in Maine was charged with Sophie‚Äôs death. He‚Äôd attended the University of Fairbanks from 1992 to 1996 and lived in the same dorm building at the time of the murder. He was tracked down due to a DNA sample his Aunt uploaded to the website GEDMatch and identified due to the hard work of CeCe Moore, a geneticist based in California. 

Just goes to show you that the capture of the Golden State Killer has just blasted the doors wide on this technology! Hopefully this means more cold cases will be solved and more killers brought to justice.

Help finding a murder discussed on the show?,"[EDIT: I found it! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brandt]

I'm trying to find a murder that was discussed on the show. It was probably about a year or two ago (ish), I'm not sure if it was Karen's or Georgia's.

It was a man and a woman who went to stay with their niece and then everyone (or multiple people?) were found murdered in the garage. I remember it being shocking because everyone thought the uncle was the nicest guy ever, but turns out he was a secret serial killer.

I want to look into it more because it's a really interesting one.

Hometown Too Sad for MFM,"Most hometowns they read these days are lighthearted and short, but I think the world should hear my insane tale. I have a story to share that involves a psycho frat boy, kitties, an escape room game, myself, and a Facebook message.   
Before I get too ahead of myself, let me give you some background information. My name is Ashlyn, I‚Äôm a 22 year old recent college grad, and I live in a small college town in Alabama called Montevallo. It‚Äôs a beautiful little place full of liberals, gays, artists, and cats. Two years before I moved here, the University of Montevallo was terrorized by the Montevallo Cat Killer. In 2012, someone went around the campus publicly displaying the bodies of dismembered cats. One of the cats was strung up the flagpole in the center of campus, one was left on a famous University sculpture, and another was displayed on the lawn of the University president‚Äôs house. The cats had been tortured and drowned. This was obviously the work of a psychopath/probable dog person. It was discovered that the killer was a 19 year old student, frat guy, and part-time campus groundskeeper named Christian Slaton. He was caught by police after he wrote a letter to his dad describing his crimes and saying that, if he didn‚Äôt get enough attention, his next victim would be female. His father called the police to turn him in. When the police arrived at his apartment, they found another dead cat in the woods behind his apartment, as well as in his bathtub where he had been drowning them. Apparently, he began the killing after a bad breakup with his girlfriend, who was in the same sorority as I was.   
He ended up being tried as a minor for first degree cruelty to cats, and, from what I understand, he did not face jail time. He was banned from the city of Montevallo.  
I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should send this in or not since it didn‚Äôt really fit the usual interests, but I thought people might find it uncomfortably interesting. That‚Äôs why, in November, when I met a girl who was close friends with his ex-girlfriend, I made her tell me everything she knew. She told me that Slaton had changed his name and moved east to one of those states over there, and she gave me his new, secret name. In true murderino fashion, I went home and found his new identity on Instagram. To call his account creepy would be an understatement. One of his recent pictures was of him posing with his new girlfriend who was wearing a cat costume on Halloween. That‚Äôs quality irony! It also showed a picture of the new business he had just opened. No joke, this dude is the proud new owner of a fucking Escape Room game business! I was mesmerized, and I wanted to be able to show my friends, so I followed his account. I guess I thought I was invisible or something, even though my Instagram bio at the time clearly included my college and my sorority letters (same sorority as his ex girlfriend‚Äôs). I woke up the next morning to a follow request from him. I regretted everything and blocked him immediately. Hours later, he went through the effort of finding me on Facebook. Then he sent me this message. It said, ‚ÄúHey, Ashlyn! I can‚Äôt help but notice that you followed me on Instagram and then promptly disappeared. I can also see that you are at Montevallo, so I assume that must be how we know each other. I just wanted to see if you had anything you wanted to ask me or talk about. If not, no worries! Just extending the offer. Cheers!üì∑‚Äù Yeah, I felt very safe and secure when I opened a Facebook message from my town‚Äôs known cat torturer. Plus, it seemed like he wanted to tell me all about it. Again, I regretted my life‚Äôs choices, and I blocked him. I was DUMB, but I at least got a good story out of it.

‚ÄúScary‚Äù book recommendations,"Hi everyone!

I know we get a thread like this every week, but I started a reading challenge and hoping to read a book a week or so for the rest of the year! 

I have either read or added to my amazon list most likely all of the true crime/other books that were mentioned on the podcast. 

Been reading a few fictional thrillers but not getting the heebie-jeebies as much, which I am surprisingly missing as a single girl living by herself. Im also getting a little tired of guessing and being right on the whodunnits in my mystery books. 

Looking for some recommendations along the true crime genre (also fictionalized if it is good) that can range from creepy to don‚Äôt read this at night alone. Also ones that had crazy endings that you couldn‚Äôt guess, etc. 

 I read ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be gone in the dark‚Äù prior to the GSK getting caught and that freaked me out a little where I couldn‚Äôt read it at night. 

Interested in any and all recommendations! I‚Äôm on book 4/52 for this year. A little behind, but can easily catch up if I‚Äôm interested in the topics. üôÇ

The Amber Alert was issued for an 11 year old girl whose father had said he was going to hurt himself and daughter. Unfortunately, he murdered his daughter before he was arrested. They found the daughter and made the arrest directly because of a tip from the Amber Alert. 

People are so concerned that they may have lost sleep while there is a mother out there who lost her sweet baby angel. Unfortunately, that is not a sentiment shared in those forums.

Ok hi so I, like many others haven't been liking episodes the past few weeks. I get really frustrated because it feels like recording is a chore for K&amp;G now, compared to their old episodes I just can't get into the new ones most of the time. Yadda Yadda... we've heard it. 

Anyway ,my issue is that whenever I see someone else commenting on this or giving any sort of negative (but respectful) critique to mfm/k&amp;g their posts get brutally downvoted and they meet with backlash of ""IT'S FREE SO DON'T COMPLAIN"" or ""STFU AND JUST STOP LISTENING THEN"". 
And I don't get it because we have the right to state our opinion, especially when a lot of us really love(d) the podcast and we're just disappointed. I don't see anyone slandering K&amp;G or giving any random hate and yet this community seems to have a problem with feedback that's anything other than ass-kissing. 

And btw it's not free, we listen to ca 5 ads per episode, buy merch, etc. So as consumers we should have the right to express our opinion without the fear of being attacked for it .

Just got into my favorite murder!,"Hi everyone! New murderino here! 

I just wanted to share that I‚Äôm excited to join this community! I used to be into making YouTube videos to honor the lives of murder victims, but I have gotten out of it due to life just being to hectic! I love listening to the podcast at work and I really enjoy how Georgia and Karen interact with each other, the subject matter, and the fans! 

Excited to be here! ",myfavoritemurder,5
Toronto Show!,"Hi Murderinos! 

I got tickets to the show on the 24th, and unfortunately something popped up with work and I have to work that night. So I was hoping to maybe switch tickets with someone that is going on the 23rd, or buy tickets off someone for the 23rd/ sell mine for the 24th. Please PM me if interested in helping a fellow murderino out! ",myfavoritemurder,0
Please Help! Episode information request!!,"Hey murderino‚Äôs!! 

I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall can help me find a specific episode, it‚Äôs an old one and the details that I can remember are vague at best;

It was about a woman that was murdered by her husband, I believe he shot her in their home and her parents were really weird about it and kinda sided with him and said that they really loved him and that she must‚Äôve pushed him to it if I remember rightly. 

I listened to Dirty John when it first came out and I‚Äôve just been watching the TV show, the murder of Cindi Newell/Vickers reminded me of the case that K&amp;G discusses... I think it‚Äôs a pretty old episode.

Any help would be hugely appreciated!

Does anyone else feel like they should start a second podcast for all their personal banter?,"I love the girls personalities but these intros are getting absolutely ridiculous. Does it really need to take 25 mins to get to the stories? Why not just have one podcast where they can gossip and chat about their vacations and all the mundane boujee stuff they enjoy, and then keep mfm for the actual murder. Or at very least wait to talk about all that stuff at the end. I can't be the only one who feels this way. ",myfavoritemurder,19
My favorite transcription?,"Hey gang!

I've heard of some podcasts getting their episodes transcribed for deaf and hard-of-hearing people. Does anyone know if anyone's transcribed My Favorite Murder? If not, would anyone be interested in starting that project up with me? It'd be a fun way to revisit the older episodes and bring some new murderinos into the fold!",myfavoritemurder,8
Giving gifts at live shows,"Hello murderinos üòÅ 

I am going to the Pittsburgh live show in March and I wanted to give the ladies each a necklace that I make but I have no idea how to go about doing this! Does anyone have a tip on how to get them gifts? They always talk about treats and paintings in their dressing rooms so I feel like there has to be a way! 

I have just regular tickets, not VIP, so I won't be meeting them unfortunately. 

Thanks for any advice!",myfavoritemurder,2
'Fuckint Hooray!' and my mental health.,"Hey fellow murderinos!

Something I have been doing daily for a few months is my 'greatfuls'.

We started in group therapy and I have continued every night.

You write down three things you are greatful for (could be micro or macro, about yourself or the world) and then something you did well that day, and something you could have done better.

It has been shown that reflecting on things that you are greatful for has a very profound effect on your mental health and happiness! A similar effect as meditation. 

So, anyone who wants to join me in doing their daily 'Fucking Hooray's should please do so!

Maybe we will have a Fucking Hooray Friday!",myfavoritemurder,2
The fan cult discussion redux,"So now that the fan cult has been around a little while and there is weekly content being published (so they say), what do people think about it now, and is it worth joining?

Rebel Without a Cause curse,"Does anybody else find it extremely interesting that all three of the actors who played main roles in the movie Rebel Without a Cause died very young and under suspicious circumstances. Natalie Wood supposedly drowned aged 43 but many believe she was murdered, Sal Mineo was stabbed aged 37 and James Dean of course died in a car accident aged only 24. I noticed this a while ago and just remembered it today.",myfavoritemurder,8
